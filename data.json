TFs search for their DNA promoter target by alternating between bulk diffusion and sliding along the DNA, a mechanism known as facilitated diffusion. We study a facilitated diffusion framework with switching between three search modes: a bulk mode and two sliding modes triggered by conformational changes between two protein conformations. In one conformation (search mode) the TF interacts unspecifically with the DNA backbone resulting in fast sliding. In the other conformation (recognition mode) it interacts specifically and strongly with DNA base pairs leading to slow displacement. From the bulk, a TF associates with the DNA at a random position that is correlated with the previous dissociation point, which implicitly is a function of the DNA structure. The target affinity depends on the conformation. We derive exact expressions for the mean first passage time (MFPT) to bind to the promoter and the conditional probability to bind before detaching when arriving at the promoter site. We systematically explore the parameter space and compare various search scenarios. We compare our results with experimental data for the dimeric Lac repressor search in E. coli bacteria. We find that a coiled DNA conformation is absolutely necessary for a fast MFPT.

They detected the emission of non-thermal radiation that they were searching for, but were surprised that it contained spectral peaks suggesting modulation at various frequencies and their harmonics. Ruf et al. hypothesized that the emission of non-thermal radiation was caused by electric discharges in a deep convective dust storm, modulated by Schumann resonances (SRs). Anderson et al. used the Allen Telescope Array (ATA) to search for similar emissions. They stated that they found only radio frequency interference (RFI) during their search for non-thermal emission by martian dust storms and implicitly suggested that the signal detected by Ruf et al. was also RFI. However, their search was not conducted during the dust storm season when deep convective storms are most likely to occur. Here, we show that the ubiquitous dust devils and small-scale dust storms that were instead likely present during their observations are too shallow to excite SRs and produce the signals detected by Ruf et al. We also show that the spectral and temporal behavior of the signals detected by Anderson et al. corroborates the idea that they originated from man-made pulse-modulated telecommunication signals rather than martian electric discharges. In contrast, an identical presentation of the signals detected by Ruf et al. demonstrates that they do not resemble man-made signals. The presentation indicates that the DSN signals were consistent with modulation by martian SRs, as originally hypothesized by Ruf et al.

Who hasn't gone through this experience when\nleaving, in a hurry, to attend to some urgent matter?  The keys could\nbe in many different places.  Unless one remembers where he or she has\nleft the keys, the only solution is to look around, more or less randomly.\nRandom searches are common because in many cases the locations of the\nspecific targets are not known  a priori. Indeed, such problems have been\ndiscussed in diverse contexts, attracting the interest of scientists from\nmany fields, for example: the dynamical or stochastic search for a stable\nminimum in a complex energy landscape, relevant to systems such as \nglasses,\nprotein (folding), and others; oil recovery from mature reservoirs; \nproteins\nsearching for their specific target sites on DNA; animal foraging; \nsurvival\nat the edge of extinction due to low availability of energetic resources;\nautomated searches of registers in high-capacity databases, search engine\n(e.g., `crawlers') that explore the internet; and even pizza delivery in\na jammed traffic system of a medium-size town. In this way, the subject is\ninteresting, challenging and has recently become an important scientific\narea of investigation.\nAlthough the applications are diverse, the underlying physical mechanisms\nare the same which will become clear in this special issue. \nMoreover,\nthe inherent complexity of the problem, the abundance of ideas and \nmethods\nfound in this growing interdisciplinary field of research is studied in\nmany areas of physics. In particular, the concepts and methods of \nstatistical\nmechanics are particularly useful to the study of random searches. On\none hand, it centres on how to find the global or local maxima of search\nefficiency functions with incomplete information. This is, of course, \nrelated\nto the long tradition in physics of using different conceptual and \nmathematical\ntools, such as variational methods, to extremize relevant quantities, e.g., \nenergy,\nentropy and action. Such ideas and approaches are very important to solve\ncomputationally complex problems (e.g., protein folding), which involve\noptimizations in very high dimensional energy landscapes. On the other \nhand,\nrandom searches can also be studied from the perspective of diffusion and\ntransport properties which is an important topic in condensed matter and \nstatistical\nphysics. For instance, the features of light scattered in a \nmedia,\nwhere the scatterers have a power-law distribution of sizes in many \naspects,\nmay resemble the patterns generated by a searcher performing Lévy walks.\nThere are many questions related to random searches: how the searcher\nmoves or should move, what are the patterns generated during the\nlocomotion, how do the encounter rates depend on parameters of the\nsearch, etc. But perhaps, the most well known issue is how\nto optimize the search for specific target scenarios. The optimization\ncan be in either continuous or discrete environments, when the information\navailable is limited. The answer to this question determines specific\nstrategies of movement that would maximize some properly defined\nsearch efficiency measure. The relevance of the question stems from the\nfact that the strategy-dynamics represents one of the most important \nfactors\nthat modulate the rate of encounters (e.g., the encounter rate between\npredator and prey).  In the general context, strategy choices can be\nessential in determining the outcome and thus the success of a given\nsearch. For instance, realistic searches—and locomotion in\ngeneral—require the expenditure of energy. Thus, inefficient search\ncould deplete energy reserves (e.g., fat) and lead to rates of\nencounters below a minimum acceptable threshold (resulting in extinction\nof a species, for example).\nThe framework of the random search `game' distinguishes between the\ntwo interacting players in a context of pursuit and chance. They are\neither a `searcher' (e.g., predator, protein, radar, `crawler') or a `target' (e.g., prey, DNA sequence, a missing aircraft,\na given web site). Regarding the nature of the searching drive, in\ncertain instances, it can be guided almost entirely by external cues,\neither by the cognitive (memory) or detective (olfaction, vision, etc)\nskills of the searcher. However, in many situations the movement is\nnon-oriented, being in essence a stochastic process. Therefore, in\nsuch cases (and even when a small deterministic component in the\nlocomotion exists) a random search effectively defines the final rates\nof encounters.\nHence, one reason underlying the richness of the random search problem\nrelates just to the `ignorance' of the locations of the randomly\nlocated targets. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the lack of complete\ninformation does not necessarily lead to greater complexity. As an\nillustrative example, let us consider the case of complete information.\nIf the positions of all target sites are known in advance, then the\nquestion of what sequential order to visit the sites so to reduce the\nenergy costs of locomotion itself becomes a rather challenging problem:\nthe famous `travelling salesman' optimization query, belonging to\nthe NP-complete class of problems. The ignorance of the target site\nlocations, however, considerably modifies the problem and renders\nit not amenable to be treated by purely deterministic computational\nmethods. In fact, as expected, the random search problem is not\nparticularly suited to search algorithms that do not use elements\nof randomness.\nSo, only a statistical approach to the search problem can adequately deal\nwith the element of ignorance. In other words, the incomplete information renders the search under-determined, i.e.,\nit is not possible to find the `best' solution to the problem because\nall the information is not given. Instead, one must guess and \nprobabilistic\nor stochastic strategies become unavoidable. Also, the random search\nproblem bears a relation to reaction–diffusion processes, because the\nsearch involves a diffusive aspect, movement, as well as a reactive\ncomponent, e.g., eating, mating, etc.\nFrom the comments above, it is clear that the subject can be treated\nfrom the perspective of different fields and subfields of physics and\nmathematics: statistical mechanics, stochastic processes, Lévy walks\nand flights, complex systems, fractal geometry, and non-linear\nphenomena. Some important questions in random searches, especially in\nthe case of discrete landscapes, are also associated with graph\ntheory, random lattices, and complex networks.\nThe aim of this special issue is to bring together, in a single \npublication,\nall or most of the relevant theoretical concepts–ideas together with \ndiscussions\nof recent findings that are important for understanding the main elements \nof\nrandom searches. In addition, we will address the types of problems which are \ncharacteristic\nof random searching.

data in coincidence with the LIGO and GEO gravitational-wave (GW) detectors. These data have been searched for GWs emitted by cataclysmic phenomena in the universe, by non-axisymmetric rotating neutron stars or from a stochastic background in the frequency band of the detectors. The sensitivity of GW searches is limited by noise produced by the detector or its environment. It is therefore crucial to characterize the various noise sources in a GW detector. This paper reviews the Virgo detector noise sources, noise propagation, and conversion mechanisms which were identified in the three first Virgo observing runs. In many cases, these investigations allowed us to mitigate noise sources in the detector, or to selectively flag noise events and discard them from the data. We present examples from the joint LIGO-GEO-Virgo GW searches to show how well noise transients and narrow spectral lines have been identified and excluded from the Virgo data. We also discuss how detector characterization can improve the astrophysical reach of GW searches.", "titre": "The characterization of Virgo data and its impact on gravitational-wave searches", "type": "Journal article", "lienPDF": "/article/10.1088/0264-9381/29/15/155002/pdf", "doi": "10.1088/0264-9381/29/15/155002"}, {"authors": "N.

Data were searched for both periodic and aperiodic sources, up to 1000 pc cm–3  in dispersion measure and on timescales from ~50 μs  to several seconds. The galaxy was sampled with 12 ALFA pointings, or 84 pixels in total, each of which was searched for 2-3 hr. We describe the observations, search methodologies, and analysis strategies applicable to multibeam systems, and comment on the data quality and statistics of spurious events that arise due to radio frequency interference. While these searches have not led to any conclusive signals of periodic or transient nature that originate in the galaxy, they illustrate some of the underlying challenges and difficulties in such searches and the efficacy of simultaneous multiple beams in the analysis of search output. The implied limits are 5 μJy Mpc2  in luminosity (at 1400 MHz) for periodic sources in M33 with duty cycles 5%. For short-duration transient signals (with pulse widths 100 μs ), the limiting peak flux density is 100 mJy, which would correspond to a 5σ detection of bright giant pulses (~20 kJy) from Crab-like pulsars if located at the distance of M33. We discuss the implications of our null results for various source populations within the galaxy and comment on the future prospects to conduct even more sensitive searches with the upcoming next-generation instruments including the Square Kilometer Array and its pathfinders.", "titre": "An Arecibo Search for Pulsars and Transient Sources in M33", "type": "Journal article", "lienPDF": "/article/10.1088/0004-637X/732/1/14/pdf", "doi": "10.1088/0004-637X/732/1/14"}, {"authors": "R.

Data were collected using the partially completed IceCube detector in the 40-string configuration recorded between 2008 April 5 and 2009 May 20, totaling 375.5 days livetime. An unbinned maximum likelihood ratio method is used to search for astrophysical signals. The data sample contains 36,900 events: 14,121 from the northern sky, mostly muons induced by atmospheric neutrinos, and 22,779 from the southern sky, mostly high-energy atmospheric muons. The analysis includes searches for individual point sources and stacked searches for sources in a common class, sometimes including a spatial extent. While this analysis is sensitive to TeV-PeV energy neutrinos in the northern sky, it is primarily sensitive to neutrinos with energy greater than about 1 PeV in the southern sky. No evidence for a signal is found in any of the searches. Limits are set for neutrino fluxes from astrophysical sources over the entire sky and compared to predictions. The sensitivity is at least a factor of two better than previous searches (depending on declination), with 90% confidence level muon neutrino flux upper limits being between E\n2\ndΦ/dE ~ 2-200 × 10–12 TeV cm–2 s–1 in the northern sky and between 3-700 × 10–12 TeV cm–2 s–1 in the southern sky. The stacked source searches provide the best limits to specific source classes.

We investigate in particular our sensitivity to additional transits in the dynamically favorable 3:2 and 2:1 exterior resonances with the known exoplanets: if we assume coplanar orbits with the known planets, then companions in these resonances with HAT-P-4b, WASP-3b, and HAT-P-7b would be expected to transit, and we can set lower limits on the radii of companions in these systems. In the nearly grazing exoplanetary systems TrES-3 and TrES-2, additional coplanar planets in these resonances are not expected to transit.

Clusters of muon neutrinos over the expected atmospheric background have been looked for. No clear signal has been found. The most signal-like accumulation of events is located at equatorial coordinates R.A. = –468 and decl. = –649 and corresponds to a 2.2σ background fluctuation. In addition, upper limits on the flux normalization of an E\n–2 muon neutrino energy spectrum have been set for 50 pre-selected astrophysical objects. Finally, motivated by an accumulation of seven events relatively close to the Galactic Center in the recently reported neutrino sample of the IceCube telescope, a search for point sources in a broad region around this accumulation has been carried out. No indication of a neutrino signal has been found in the ANTARES data and upper limits on the flux normalization of an E\n–2 energy spectrum of neutrinos from point sources in that region have been set. The 90% confidence level upper limits on the muon neutrino flux normalization vary between 3.5 and 5.1 × 10–8 GeV cm–2 s–1, depending on the exact location of the source.", "titre": "Searches for Point-like and Extended Neutrino Sources Close to the Galactic Center Using the ANTARES Neutrino Telescope", "type": "Journal article", "lienPDF": "/article/10.1088/2041-8205/786/1/L5/pdf", "doi": "10.1088/2041-8205/786/1/L5"}, {"authors": "Uttam Bhat, Caterina De Bacco and S Redner", "annee": "2016", "resume": "We investigate a stochastic search process in one, two, and three dimensions in which N diffusing searchers that all start at x\n0 seek a target at the origin.

The beam angle optimization (BAO) in intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) consists of selecting appropriate radiation incidence directions and may influence the quality of the IMRT plans, both to enhance better organ sparing and to improve tumor coverage. However, in clinical practice, most of the time, beam directions continue to be manually selected by the treatment planner without objective and rigorous criteria. The goal of this paper is to introduce a novel approach that uses beam's-eye-view dose ray tracing metrics within a pattern search method framework in the optimization of the highly non-convex BAO problem. Pattern search methods are derivative-free optimization methods that require a few function evaluations to progress and converge and have the ability to better avoid local entrapment. The pattern search method framework is composed of a search step and a poll step at each iteration. The poll step performs a local search in a mesh neighborhood and ensures the convergence to a local minimizer or stationary point. The search step provides the flexibility for a global search since it allows searches away from the neighborhood of the current iterate. Beam's-eye-view dose metrics assign a score to each radiation beam direction and can be used within the pattern search framework furnishing a priori knowledge of the problem so that directions with larger dosimetric scores are tested first. A set of clinical cases of head-and-neck tumors treated at the Portuguese Institute of Oncology of Coimbra is used to discuss the potential of this approach in the optimization of the BAO problem.", "titre": "Beam angle optimization for intensity-modulated radiation therapy using a guided pattern search method", "type": "Journal article", "lienPDF": "/article/10.1088/0031-9155/58/9/2939/pdf", "doi": "10.1088/0031-9155/58/9/2939"}, {"authors": "Weiwei Zhu and Victoria M.

We searched for microvariability on 33 nights. Strong evidence for microvariability was found only for our lowest luminosity object, NGC 4051, on one night. Weaker evidence suggests such variability on a few other nights for two other objects, but the data are not as convincing. Intranight variability in NLS1's is thus concluded to be rare and of low amplitude. We give illustrations of how variable image quality can produce spurious variability. We find that for well-studied non-NLS1's there is a spread in the amplitude of seasonal variability (i.e., in some years an active galactic nucleus [AGN] is more variable than in others). We find that the means of the variability amplitudes of non-NLS1's over several seasons vary from object to object (i.e., some AGNs are, on average, more variable than others). NLS1's also show a spread in seasonal variabilities. The best-studied NLS1, Ark 564, shows a range of amplitudes of variability from season to season that is comparable to the range found in broad-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (BLS1's), and in one season Ark 564 was as variable as the most variable non-NLS1. The seasonal amplitudes of variability for NLS1's are mostly in the lower half of the range of non-BLS1 seasonal amplitudes, but the absence of a suitable control sample makes a precise comparison difficult. However, on long timescales (weeks to years) NLS1's as a class are not more variable than non-NLS1's. The extreme variability seen in the X-rays was not seen in the optical.

For the first time, a search is performed over the entire parameter space of energy, direction, and time with sensitivity to neutrino flares lasting between 20 μs and a year duration from astrophysical sources. Searches that integrate over time are less sensitive to flares because they are affected by a larger background of atmospheric neutrinos and muons that can be reduced by the use of additional timing information. Flaring sources considered here, such as active galactic nuclei, soft gamma-ray repeaters, and gamma-ray bursts, are promising candidate neutrino emitters. Two searches are \"untriggered\" in the sense that they look for any possible flare in the entire sky and from a predefined catalog of sources from which photon flares have been recorded. The other two searches are triggered by multi-wavelength information on flares from blazars and from a soft gamma-ray repeater. One triggered search uses lightcurves from Fermi-LAT which provides continuous monitoring. A second triggered search uses information where the flux states have been measured only for short periods of time near the flares. The untriggered searches use data taken by 40 strings of IceCube between 2008 April 5 and 2009 May 20. The triggered searches also use data taken by the 22-string configuration of IceCube operating between 2007 May 31 and 2008 April 5.

Higher criticism is designed to detect a group of sparse, weak sources, none of which are strong enough to be reliably estimated or detected individually. We apply higher criticism as a second-pass method to synthetic -statistic and -statistic data for a monochromatic periodic source in a binary system and quantify the improvement relative to the first-pass methods. We find that higher criticism on -statistic data is more sensitive by ~6% than the -statistic alone under optimal conditions (i.e., binary orbit known exactly) and the relative advantage increases as the error in the orbital parameters increases. Higher criticism is robust even when the source is not monochromatic (e.g., phase-wandering in an accreting system). Applying higher criticism to a phase-wandering source over multiple time intervals gives a  30% increase in detectability with few assumptions about the frequency evolution.

Simplicity is the outstanding advantage of a search in spectra. The spectra can be analyzed by simple eye inspection or a few lines of code that uses Fourier transform software. Theory, confirmed by published experiments, shows that periodic signals in spectra can be easily generated by sending light pulses separated by constant time intervals. While part of this article, like all articles on SETIs, is highly speculative the basic physics is sound. In particular, technology now available on Earth could be used to send signals having the required energy to be detected at a target located 1000 lt-yr away.

Contributions from these multiple channels to the overall experimental sensitivity (cross-section times branching ratio) are model-independent and can be parametrized in terms of relevant new particle masses. Given the trileptonic branching ratios of a specific model, these experimentally obtained multi-channel sensitivities can be combined to obtain a cross-section measurement that can be used to confront the model with data. Our model-independent results are more widely applicable than the current Tevatron trilepton results which are stated exclusively in terms of mSUGRA parameters of supersymmetry.

The majority of the latter WDs are central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPNs). We have therefore used archival Spitzer Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) and Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS) observations of PNs to search for CSPNs with IR excesses and to make a comparative investigation of dust disks around stars at different evolutionary stages. We have examined available images of 72 resolved PNs in the Spitzer archive and found 56 of them large enough for the CSPN to be resolved from the PN. Among these, only 42 CSPNs are visible in IRAC and/or MIPS images and selected for photometric measurements. From the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of these CSPNs, we find 19 cases with clear IR excess. Of these, seven are [WC]-type stars, two have apparent visual companions that account for the observed excess emission, two are symbiotic CSPNs, and in eight cases the IR excess originates from an extended emitter, likely a dust disk. For some of these CSPNs, we have acquired follow-up Spitzer MIPS images, Infrared Spectrograph spectra, and Gemini NIRI and Michelle spectroscopic observations. The SEDs and spectra show a great diversity in the emission characteristics of the IR excesses, which may imply different mechanisms responsible for the excess emission. For CSPNs whose IR excesses originate from dust continuum, the most likely dust production mechanisms are (1) breakup of bodies in planetesimal belts through collisions and (2) formation of circumstellar dust disks through binary interactions. A better understanding of post-asymptotic giant branch binary evolution as well as debris disk evolution along with its parent star is needed to distinguish between these different origins.

This search has been performed by modeling both the Kepler pre-search data conditioned light curves and new light curves produced via our own photometric pipeline. We derive new stellar and planetary parameters for each system, while calculating robust errors for both. We find 16 systems with 1σ-2σ, 14 systems with 2σ-3σ, and 6 systems with >3σ confidence level secondary eclipse detections in at least one light curve produced via the Kepler pre-search data conditioned light curve or our own pipeline; however, results can vary depending on the light curve modeled and whether eccentricity is allowed to vary or not. We estimate false alarm probabilities of 31%, 10%, and 6% for the 1σ-2σ, 2σ-3σ, and >3σ confidence intervals, respectively. Comparing each secondary eclipse result to theoretical expectations, we find that the majority of detected planet candidates emit more light than expected owing to thermal blackbody emission in the optical Kepler bandpass, and present a trend of increasing excess emission with decreasing maximum effective planetary temperature. These results agree with previously published optical secondary eclipse data for other hot Jupiters. We explore modeling biases, significant planetary albedos, non-local thermodynamic equilibrium or other thermal emission, significant internal energy generation, and misidentification of brown dwarfs, low-mass stars, or stellar blends as possible causes of both the excess emission and its correlation with expected planetary temperature. Although we find that no single cause is able to explain all of the planet candidates, significant planetary albedos, with a general trend of increasing planetary albedos with decreasing atmospheric temperatures, are able to explain most of the systems. Identifying systems that we deem likely to be low-mass stars or stellar blends, we estimate an 11% false-positive rate in the current Kepler planet candidate sample of hot Jupiters. We also establish robust upper limits on the eclipse depth for the remaining systems and find that the emission of a significant fraction of these systems is consistent with the planets having very low albedos, i.e., at least 30% of all systems have Ag\n < 0.3 at 1σ confidence levels.

Careful visual inspection of all publicly available optical and ultraviolet imaging at the position of the UCHVCs revealed six blue, diffuse counterparts with a morphology consistent with a faint dwarf galaxy beyond the Local Group. Optical spectroscopy of all six candidate dwarf counterparts show that five have an Hα-derived velocity consistent with the coincident HI cloud, confirming their association; the sixth diffuse counterpart is likely a background object. The size and luminosity of the UCHVC dwarfs is consistent with other known Local Volume dwarf irregular galaxies. The gas fraction () of the five dwarfs are generally consistent with that of dwarf irregular galaxies in the Local Volume, although ALFALFA-Dw1 (associated with ALFALFA UCHVC HVC274.68+74.70–123) has a very high  ~ 40. Despite the heterogenous nature of our search, we demonstrate that the current dwarf companions to UCHVCs are at the edge of detectability due to their low surface brightness, and that deeper searches are likely to find more stellar systems.

The physical interpretation for the FRBs remains unclear but is thought to involve highly compact objects at cosmological distance. It has been suggested that a fraction of FRBs could be physically associated with gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Recent radio observations of GRBs have reported the detection of two highly dispersed short duration radio pulses using a 12 m radio telescope at 1.4 GHz. Motivated by this result, we have performed a systematic and sensitive search for FRBs associated with GRBs. We have observed five GRBs at 2.3 GHz using a 26 m radio telescope located at the Mount Pleasant Radio Observatory, Hobart. The radio telescope was automated to rapidly respond to Gamma-ray Coordination Network notifications from the Swift satellite and slew to the GRB position within ~140 s. The data were searched for pulses up to 5000 pc cm–3 in dispersion measure and pulse widths ranging from 640 μs to 25.60 ms. We did not detect any events ≥6σ. An in depth statistical analysis of our data shows that events detected above 5σ are consistent with thermal noise fluctuations only.

One of the ideas of the method is to search for possible correlations between UHECR masses and their separate sources; for instance, if there are two sources in different areas of the celestial sphere injecting different nuclei, but the fluxes are comparable so that arrival directions are isotropic, then the aim is to reveal a difference in the mass composition of cosmic-ray fluxes.

Every transiting planet discovered will have a measured radius, which will provide constraints on planet composition, evolution, and migration history. Together with radial velocity measurements, the absolute mass of every transiting planet will be determined. In this paper we discuss the design considerations of the Extrasolar Planet Occultation Research (EXPLORE) project, a series of transiting planet searches using 4 m class telescopes to continuously monitor a single field of stars in the Galactic plane in each ~2 week observing campaign. We discuss the general factors that determine the efficiency and the number of planets found by a transit search, including time sampling strategy and field selection. The primary goal is to select the most promising planet candidates for radial velocity follow-up observations. We show that with very high photometric precision light curves that have frequent time sampling and at least two detected transits, it is possible to uniquely solve for the main parameters of the eclipsing system (including planet radius), based on several important assumptions about the central star. Together with a measured spectral type for the star, this unique solution for orbital parameters provides a powerful method for ruling out most contaminants to transiting planet candidates. For the EXPLORE project, radial velocity follow-up observations for companion mass determination of the best candidates are done on 8 m class telescopes within 2 or 3 months of the photometric campaigns. This same-season follow-up is made possible by the use of efficient pipelines to produce high-quality light curves within weeks of the observations. We conclude by presenting early results from our first search, EXPLORE I, in which we reached better than 1% rms photometric precision (measured over a full night) on ~37,000 stars with 14.5 ≤ I ≤ 18.2.", "titre": "The EXPLORE Project.

This paper deals with the search for this extensive (and, so far, elusive) population, and concentrates on the formation of spheroidal systems (bulges and halos) since there is considerable evidence that disk formation was more quiescent. The review begins with a summary of the expected model independent properties of primeval galaxies. Particular attention is paid to the redshift of galaxy formation; empirical evidence is presented that supports galaxy formation at z < 5; however, there exist persuasive arguments that at least some galaxy formation must have taken place at higher redshifts. A major part of this review concerns primeval galaxy search strategies. Most (although not all) constraints on the properties of primeval galaxies come from searches for Ly-alpha emitting objects. Flux limits for these searches have now reached levels at which surveys should, according to simple models, have detected a total of 101-3 objects; yet no really good candidates have been found. This discrepancy between models and observations can possibly be explained by a combination of (i) dust absorption, and (ii) finite angular extent, which degrades flux limits.

The targets of the search include 112,321 targets that were observed over the full interval and an additional 79,992 targets that were observed for a subset of the full interval. From this set of targets we find a total of 11,087 targets that contain at least one signal that meets the Kepler detection criteria: periodicity of the signal, an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio, and three tests that reject false positives. Each target containing at least one detected signal is then searched repeatedly for additional signals, which represent multi-planet systems of transiting planets. When targets with multiple detections are considered, a total of 18,406 potential transiting planet signals are found in the Kepler mission data set. The detected signals are dominated by events with relatively low signal-to-noise ratios and by events with relatively short periods. The distribution of estimated transit depths appears to peak in the range between 20 and 30 parts per million, with a few detections down to fewer than 10 parts per million. The detections exhibit signal-to-noise ratios from 7.1σ, which is the lower cutoff for detections, to over 10,000σ, and periods ranging from 0.5 days, which is the shortest period searched, to 525 days, which is the upper limit of achievable periods given the length of the data set and the requirement that all detections include at least three transits.

For each star, we report on variability, periodicity, and long-term velocity trends. Our sample of stars contains eight known companions with mass (Mp sin i) less than 8 Jupiter masses (MJ), six of which were discovered at Lick. For the remaining stars, we place upper limits on the companion mass as a function of orbital period. For most stars, we can exclude companions with velocity amplitude K  20 m s-1 at the 99% level, or Mp sin i  0.7MJ(a/AU)1/2 for orbital radii a  5 AU. We examine the implications of our results for the observed distribution of mass and orbital radius of companions. We show that the combination of intrinsic stellar variability and measurement errors most likely explains why all confirmed companions so far have K  40 m s-1. The finite duration of the observations limits detection of Jupiter-mass companions to a  3 AU. Thus it remains possible that the majority of solar-type stars harbor Jupiter-mass companions much like our own, and if so these companions should be detectable in a few years. It is striking that more massive companions with Mp sin i > 3MJ are rare at orbital radii 4-6 AU; we could have detected such objects in ~90% of stars, yet found none. The observed companions show a \"piling-up\" toward small orbital radii, and there is a paucity of confirmed and candidate companions with orbital radii between ~0.2 and ~1 AU. The small number of confirmed companions means that we are not able to rule out selection effects as the cause of these features. We show that the traditional method for detecting periodicities, the Lomb-Scargle periodogram, fails to account for statistical fluctuations in the mean of a sampled sinusoid, making it nonrobust when the number of observations is small, the sampling is uneven, or for periods comparable to or greater than the duration of the observations. We adopt a \"floating-mean\" periodogram, in which the zero point of the sinusoid is allowed to vary during the fit. We discuss in detail the normalization of the periodogram and the probability distribution of periodogram powers. We stress that the three different prescriptions in the literature for normalizing the periodogram are statistically equivalent and that it is not possible to write a simple analytic form for the false alarm probability, making Monte Carlo methods essential.", "titre": "The Lick Planet Search: Detectability and Mass Thresholds", "type": "Journal article", "lienPDF": "/article/10.1086/308020/pdf", "doi": "10.1086/308020"}, {"authors": "Marco Chiaberge, Grant Tremblay, Alessandro Capetti, F.

In absence of spectroscopic redshift measurements, the selection method is based on multiple steps which make use of both radio and optical constraints. The basic assumptions are that (1) the break in radio power between low-power FR Is and the more powerful FR IIs does not change with redshift, and (2) that the photometric properties of the host galaxies of low-power radio galaxies in the distant universe are similar to those of FR IIs in the same redshift bin, as is the case for nearby radio galaxies. We describe the results of our search, which yields 37 low-power radio galaxy candidates that are possibly FR Is. We show that a large fraction of these low-luminosity radio galaxies display a compact radio morphology that does not correspond to the FR I morphological classification. Furthermore, our objects are apparently associated with galaxies that show clear signs of interactions, at odds with the typical behavior observed in low-z FR I hosts. The compact radio morphology might imply that we are observing intrinsically small and possibly young objects that will eventually evolve into the giant FR Is we observe in the local universe. One of the objects appears as pointlike in Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images. This might belong to a population of FR I-QSOs, which however would represent a tiny minority of the overall population of high-z FR Is. As for the local FR Is, a large fraction of our objects are likely to be associated with groups or clusters, making them \"beacons\" for high-redshift clusters of galaxies. Our search for candidate high-z FR Is we present in this paper constitutes a pilot study for objects to be observed with future high-resolution and high-sensitivity instruments such as the EVLA and ALMA in the radio band, HST/WFC3 in the optical and IR, James Webb Space Telescope in the IR, as well as future generation X-ray satellites.", "titre": "Low-Power Radio Galaxies in the Distant Universe: A Search for FR I at 1 < z < 2 in the Cosmos Field", "type": "Journal article", "lienPDF": "/article/10.1088/0004-637X/696/2/1103/pdf", "doi": "10.1088/0004-637X/696/2/1103"}, {"authors": "J.

In this work, we do not measure the position of the comet within each image, but rather use the celestial position of the whole image to infer the orbit. We find very strong probabilistic constraints on the orbit, although slightly off the Jet Propulsion Lab ephemeris, probably due to limitations of our model.

However, no technique currently exists that yields NIR radial velocity precision comparable to that routinely obtained in the visible. We are carrying out an NIR radial velocity planet search program targeting a sample of the lowest-mass M dwarfs using the CRIRES instrument on the Very Large Telescope. In this first paper in a planned series about the project, we describe a method for measuring high-precision relative radial velocities of these stars from K-band spectra. The method makes use of a glass cell filled with ammonia gas to calibrate the spectrograph response similar to the \"iodine cell\" technique that has been used very successfully in the visible. Stellar spectra are obtained through the ammonia cell and modeled as the product of a Doppler-shifted template spectrum of the object and a spectrum of the cell, convolved with a variable instrumental profile (IP) model. A complicating factor is that a significant number of telluric absorption lines are present in the spectral regions containing useful stellar and ammonia lines. The telluric lines are modeled simultaneously as well using spectrum synthesis with a time-resolved model of the atmosphere over the observatory. The free parameters in the complete model are the wavelength scale of the spectrum, the IP, adjustments to the water and methane abundances in the atmospheric model, telluric spectrum Doppler shift, and stellar Doppler shift. Tests of the method based on the analysis of hundreds of spectra obtained for late-M dwarfs over 6 months demonstrate that precisions of ~ 5 m s–1 are obtainable over long timescales, and precisions of better than 3 m s–1 can be obtained over timescales up to a week. The obtained precision is comparable to the predicted photon-limited errors, but primarily limited over long timescales by the imperfect modeling of the telluric lines.", "titre": "The CRIRES Search for Planets Around the Lowest-mass Stars.

We conduct a search of the high-precision time series for additional planets around GJ 436, which could be revealed either directly through their photometric transits or indirectly through the variations these second planets induce on the transits of the previously known planet. In the case of GJ 436, the presence of a second planet is perhaps indicated by the residual orbital eccentricity of the known hot Neptune companion. We find no candidate transits with significance higher than our detection limit. From Monte Carlo tests of the time series, we rule out transiting planets larger than 1.5 R\n⊕ interior to GJ 436b with 95% confidence and larger than 1.25 R\n⊕ with 80% confidence. Assuming coplanarity of additional planets with the orbit of GJ 436b, we cannot expect that putative planets with orbital periods longer than about 3.4 days will transit. However, if such a planet were to transit, we would rule out planets larger than 2.0 R\n⊕ with orbital periods less than 8.5 days with 95% confidence. We also place dynamical constraints on additional bodies in the GJ 436 system, independent of radial velocity measurements. Our analysis should serve as a useful guide for similar analyses of transiting exoplanets for which radial velocity measurements are not available, such as those discovered by the Kepler mission. From the lack of observed secular perturbations, we set upper limits on the mass of a second planet as small as 10 M\n⊕ in coplanar orbits and 1 M\n⊕ in non-coplanar orbits close to GJ 436b.

We have developed a novel locally calibrated pixel (LCP) search method that uses adjacent regions of the spectrum to calibrate interlopers and spectral artifacts, which would otherwise limit the measurement of O VI absorption. Despite the challenges presented by searching for weak O VI within the Lyα forest in spectra of moderate resolution and signal-to-noise, we find a highly significant detection of absorption by oxygen at 2.7 < z < 3.2 (the null hypothesis has a χ2 = 80 for nine data points). We interpret our results using synthetic spectra generated from a log-normal density field assuming a mixed quasar-galaxy photoionizing background and that it dominates the ionization fraction of detected O VI. The LCP search data can be fit by a constant metallicity model with [O/H] = –2.15+0.07\n–0.09 but also by models in which low-density regions are unenriched and higher density regions have a higher metallicity.

So far, however, direct evidence for such binaries has been elusive. We use cross-correlation to search for temporal velocity shifts in the Mg II broad emission lines of 0.36 < z < 2 quasars with multiple observations in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. For ∼109 M\n☉ BHs in SMBH binaries, we are sensitive to velocity drifts for binary separations of ~0.1 pc with orbital periods of ~100 yr. We find seven candidate sub-parsec-scale binaries with velocity shifts >3.4σ ~ 280 km s–1, where σ is our systematic error. Comparing the detectability of SMBH binaries with the number of candidates (N ≤ 7), we can rule out that most 109 M\n☉ BHs exist in ~0.03-0.2 pc scale binaries, in a scenario where binaries stall at sub-parsec scales for a Hubble time. We further constrain that ≤16% (one-third) of quasars host SMBH binaries after considering gas-assisted sub-parsec evolution of SMBH binaries, although this result is very sensitive to the assumed size of the broad line region. We estimate the detectability of SMBH binaries with ongoing or next-generation surveys (e.g., Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey, Subaru Prime Focus Spectrograph), taking into account the evolution of the sub-parsec binary in circumbinary gas disks.

Following this reasoning, we note that if Earth-sized trojans exist at all, they are almost certainly both present and in principle detectable in the full set of Kepler data, although a very substantial computational effort would be required to detect them.

This is, in part, because it is known that the super-diffusive properties of Lévy walks can be advantageous in random search scenarios when searchers have little or no prior knowledge of target locations. However, fractional Brownian motions (fBms) and fractional Lévy motions (fLms) are both scale-free and super-diffusive, and so it is possible that these motions rather than Lévy walks underlie some or all occurrences of scale-free animal movement patterns. Here this possibility is examined in numerical simulations through a determination of the searching efficiencies of fBm and fLm searches. It is shown that these searches are less efficient than Lévy walk searches.

These results are based on computer simulations which contain, for the first time ever, digitalized real-world water flow and chemical plume instead of their theoretical model approximations. Combining elements of LW and CRW, Lévy-taxis is particularly efficient for searching in flow-dominated environments: it adaptively controls the stochastic search pattern using environmental information (i.e. flow) that is available throughout the course of the search and shows correlation with the source providing the cues. This strategy finds natural application in real-world search missions, both by humans and autonomous robots, since it accomodates the stochastic nature of chemical mixing in turbulent flows. In addition, it may prove useful in the field of behavioral ecology, explaining and predicting the movement patterns of various animals searching for food or mates.", "titre": "Lévy-taxis: a novel search strategy for finding odor plumes in turbulent flow-dominated environments", "type": "Journal article", "lienPDF": "/article/10.1088/1751-8113/42/43/434010/pdf", "doi": "10.1088/1751-8113/42/43/434010"}, {"authors": "Leonid Mirny, Michael Slutsky, Zeba Wunderlich, Anahita Tafvizi, Jason Leith and Andrej Kosmrlj", "annee": "2009", "resume": "A number of vital biological processes rely on fast and precise recognition of a specific DNA sequence (site) by a protein. How can a protein find its site on a long DNA molecule among 106–109 decoy sites? Here, we present our recent studies of the protein–DNA search problem. Seminal biophysical works suggested that the protein–DNA search is facilitated by 1D diffusion of the protein along DNA (sliding). We present a simple framework to calculate the mean search time and focus on several new aspects of the process such as the roles of DNA sequence and protein conformational flexibility. We demonstrate that coupling of DNA recognition with conformational transition within the protein–DNA complex is essential for fast search. To approach the complexity of the in vivo environment, we examine how the search can proceed at realistic DNA concentrations and binding constants. We propose a new mechanism for local distance-dependent search that is likely essential in bacteria. Simulations of the search on tightly packed DNA and crowded DNA demonstrate that our theoretical framework can be extended to correctly predicts search time in such complicated environments. We relate our findings to a broad range of experiments and summarize the results of our recent single-molecule studies of a eukaryotic protein (p53) sliding along DNA.", "titre": "How a protein searches for its site on DNA: the mechanism of facilitated diffusion", "type": "Journal article", "lienPDF": "/article/10.1088/1751-8113/42/43/434013/pdf", "doi": "10.1088/1751-8113/42/43/434013"}, {"authors": "Vinicius M.

This method employs an extended line index for the CH G band, which we demonstrate to have superior performance when compared to the narrower G-band index formerly employed to estimate G-band strengths for these spectra. Although CEMP stars have been found previously among candidate metal-poor stars selected from the HES, the selection on metallicity undersamples the population of intermediate-metallicity CEMP stars (–2.5 ≤ [Fe/H] ≤ –1.0); such stars are of importance for constraining the onset of the s-process in metal-deficient asymptotic giant branch stars (thought to be associated with the origin of carbon for roughly 80% of CEMP stars). The new candidates also include substantial numbers of warmer carbon-enhanced stars, which were missed in previous HES searches for carbon stars due to selection criteria that emphasized cooler stars. A first subsample, biased toward brighter stars (B< 15.5), has been extracted from the scanned HES plates. After visual inspection (to eliminate spectra compromised by plate defects, overlapping spectra, etc., and to carry out rough spectral classifications), a list of 669 previously unidentified candidate CEMP stars was compiled. Follow-up spectroscopy for a pilot sample of 132 candidates was obtained with the Goodman spectrograph on the SOAR 4.1 m telescope. Our results show that most of the observed stars lie in the targeted metallicity range, and possess prominent carbon absorption features at 4300 Å. The success rate for the identification of new CEMP stars is 43% (13 out of 30) for [Fe/H] < –2.0. For stars with [Fe/H] < –2.5, the ratio increases to 80% (four out of five objects), including one star with [Fe/H] < –3.0.", "titre": "A Search for Unrecognized Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor Stars in the Galaxy", "type": "Journal article", "lienPDF": "/article/10.1088/0004-6256/139/3/1051/pdf", "doi": "10.1088/0004-6256/139/3/1051"}, {"authors": "Reka Moldovan, Jaymie M.

Observations of the presence and nature of asteroids around other stars would provide unique constraints on migration models of exoplanetary systems. Our results set an upper limit on the optical depth of Trojans in the HD 209458 system that can be used to guide current and future searches of similar systems by upcoming missions. Using cross-correlation methods with artificial signals implanted in the data, we find that our detection limit corresponds to a relative Trojan transit depth of 1 ×10–4, equivalent to ~1 lunar mass of asteroids, assuming power-law Trojan size distributions similar to Jupiter's Trojans in our solar system. We confirm with dynamical interpretations that some asteroids could have migrated inward with the planet to its current orbit at 0.045 AU, and that the Yarkovsky effect is ineffective at eliminating objects of >1 m in size. However, using numerical models of collisional evolution we find that, due to high relative speeds in this confined Trojan environment, collisions destroy the vast majority of the asteroids in <10 Myr. Our modeling indicates that the best candidates to search for exoTrojan swarms in 1:1 mean resonance orbits with “hot Jupiters” are young systems (ages of about 1 Myr or less).

We have developed a new selection process to find these missing members based on the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) All-Sky Imaging Survey (AIS). For stars with spectral types K5 (R – J  1.5) and younger than ≈300 Myr, we show that near-UV (NUV) and far-UV (FUV) emission is greatly enhanced above the quiescent photosphere, analogous to the enhanced X-ray emission of young low-mass stars seen by ROSAT but detectable to much larger distances with GALEX. By combining GALEX data with optical (HST Guide Star Catalog) and near-IR (2MASS) photometry, we identified an initial sample of 34 young M dwarf candidates in a 1000 deg2 region around the ≈10 Myr TW Hydra Association (TWA). Low-resolution spectroscopy of 30 of these found 16 which had Hα in emission, which were then followed up at high resolution to search for spectroscopic evidence of youth and to measure their radial velocities. Four objects have low surface gravities, photometric distances and space motions consistent with TWA, but the non-detection of Li indicates that they may be too old to belong to this moving group. One object (M3.5, 93 ± 19 pc) appears to be the first known accreting low-mass member of the ≈15 Myr Lower Centaurus Crux OB association. Two objects exhibit all the characteristics of the known TWA members, and thus we designate them as TWA 31 (M4.2, 110 ± 11 pc) and TWA 32 (M6.3, 53 ± 5 pc). TWA 31 shows extremely broad (447 km s–1) Hα emission, making it the sixth member of TWA found to have ongoing accretion. TWA 32 is resolved into a 06 binary in Keck laser guide star adaptive optics imaging. Our search should be sensitive down to spectral types of at least M4-M5 in TWA and thus the small numbers of new member is puzzling. This might indicate TWA has an atypical mass function or that the presence of lithium absorption may be too restrictive a criteria for selecting young low-mass stars.", "titre": "Searching for Young M

These galaxies are nearby dark matter dominated objects located at a typical distance of several tens of kiloparsecs for which there are good measurements of the dark matter density profile from stellar velocity measurements. Since the conventional astrophysical background of very high energy gamma rays from these objects appears to be negligible, they are good targets to search for the secondary gamma-ray photons produced by interacting or decaying dark matter particles. No significant gamma-ray flux above 200 GeV was detected from these four dwarf galaxies for a typical exposure of ~20 hr. The 95% confidence upper limits on the integral gamma-ray flux are in the range (0.4-2.2) × 10–12photonscm–2 s–1. We interpret this limiting flux in the context of pair annihilation of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) and derive constraints on the thermally averaged product of the total self-annihilation cross section and the relative velocity of the WIMPs (σv  10–23 cm3 s–1 for m\nχ  300 GeV c\n–2). This limit is obtained under conservative assumptions regarding the dark matter distribution in dwarf galaxies and is approximately 3 orders of magnitude above the generic theoretical prediction for WIMPs in the minimal supersymmetric standard model framework.

The comparison of the expected radio emission due to the galactic DM distribution with the observed one provides bounds which are comparable to those obtained from a similar analysis of the Milky Way. Remarkably, the present results are simply based on archival data and are thus largely improvable by means of specifically tailored observations. The potentiality of the method compared with more standard searches is discussed by considering the optimistic situation of a vanishing flux (within the experimental sensitivity) measured inside the cavity by a high-resolution radio telescope like Atacama Large Millimeter Array. Under the best conditions, our technique is able to produce bounds which are comparable to the ones expected after 5 years of Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) data taking for a hadronic annihilation channel.

However, only five Ia SNRs have been searched for SCs, showing little support for the standard channels in the singe-degenerate scenario. To better understand the progenitors of SNe Ia, we encourage the search for SCs in other nearby Ia SNRs.", "titre": "Search for Surviving Companions in Type Ia Supernova Remnants", "type": "Journal article", "lienPDF": "/article/10.1088/0004-637X/792/1/71/pdf", "doi": "10.1088/0004-637X/792/1/71"}, {"authors": "David Keitel", "annee": "2016", "resume": "Non-axisymmetries in rotating neutron stars emit quasi-monochromatic gravitational waves. These long-duration 'continuous wave' signals are among the main search targets of ground-based interferometric detectors. However, standard detection methods are susceptible to false alarms from instrumental artefacts that resemble a continuous-wave signal. Past work [Keitel, Prix, Papa, Leaci and Siddiqi 2014, Phys. Rev. D 89 064023] showed that a Bayesian approach, based on an explicit model of persistent single-detector disturbances, improves robustness against such artefacts. Since many strong outliers in semi-coherent searches of LIGO data are caused by transient disturbances that last only a few hours or days, I describe in a recent paper [Keitel D 2015, LIGO-P1500159] how to extend this approach to cover transient disturbances, and demonstrate increased sensitivity in realistic simulated data. Additionally, neutron stars could emit transient signals which, for a limited time, also follow the continuous-wave signal model. As a pragmatic alternative to specialized transient searches, I demonstrate how to make standard semi-coherent continuous-wave searches more sensitive to transient signals. Focusing on the time-scale of a single segment in the semi-coherent search, Bayesian model selection yields a simple detection statistic without a significant increase in computational cost. This proceedings contribution gives a brief overview of both works.", "titre": "Distinguishing transient signals and instrumental disturbances in semi-coherent searches for continuous gravitational waves with line-robust statistics", "type": "Journal article", "lienPDF": "/article/10.1088/1742-6596/716/1/012003/pdf", "doi": "10.1088/1742-6596/716/1/012003"}, {"authors": "B.

The data used in this analysis were collected from 2005 November 4 to 2007 October 1, and most of the GRB triggers were from the Swift satellite. The search uses a coherent network analysis method that takes into account the different locations and orientations of the interferometers at the three LIGO-Virgo sites. We find no evidence for GWB signals associated with this sample of GRBs. Using simulated short-duration (<1 s) waveforms, we set upper limits on the amplitude of gravitational waves associated with each GRB. We also place lower bounds on the distance to each GRB under the assumption of a fixed energy emission in gravitational waves, with a median limit of D ~ 12 Mpc(E\niso\nGW/0.01 M\n☉\nc\n2)1/2 for emission at frequencies around 150 Hz, where the LIGO-Virgo detector network has best sensitivity.

Guide stars are primarily used by Pan-STARRS to compensate for image motion and hence improve the point-spread function. With suitable selection of the guide stars within the Pan-STARRS 7 deg2 field of view, the light curves of these guide stars can also be used to search for occultations by TNOs. The best target stars for this purpose are stars with high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) and small angular size. In order to do this, we compiled a catalog using the S/N calculated from stars with m\nV < 13 mag in the Tycho2 catalog, then cross matched these stars with the Two Micron All Sky Survey catalog, and estimated their angular sizes from (V – K) color. We also outlined a new detection method based on matched filter that is optimized to search for diffraction patterns in the light curves due to occultation by sub-kilometer TNOs. A detection threshold is set to compromise between real detections and false positives. Depending on the theoretical size distribution model used, we expect to find up to a hundred events during the three-year lifetime of the Pan-STARRS-1 project. The high sampling (30 Hz) of the project facilitates detections of small objects (as small as 400 m), which are numerous according to power-law size distribution, and thus allows us to verify various models and further constrain our understanding of the structure in the outer reach of the solar system. We have tested the detection algorithm and the pipeline on a set of engineering data (taken at 10 Hz instead of 30 Hz). No events were found within the engineering data, which is consistent with the small size of the data set and the theoretical models. Meanwhile, with a total of ~22 star-hours video mode data (|β| < 10°), we are able to set an upper limit of N(>0.5 km) ~ 2.47 × 1010 deg–2 at 95% confidence limit.", "titre": "Searching for Sub-kilometer Trans-Neptunian Objects Using Pan-STARRS Video Mode Light Curves: Preliminary Study and Evaluation Using Engineering Data", "type": "Journal article", "lienPDF": "/article/10.1088/0004-6256/139/5/2003/pdf", "doi": "10.1088/0004-6256/139/5/2003"}, {"authors": "R.

This technique involves the indexing of the database models based on the sign of the projections (PCA coefficients) of the first few relevant orders of principal components of the four Stokes parameters. In this way, each model in the database can be attributed a distinctive binary number of 24n\n bits, where n is the number of PCA orders used for the indexing. Each of these binary numbers (indices) identifies a group of \"compatible\" models for the inversion of a given set of observed Stokes profiles sharing the same index. The complete set of the binary numbers so constructed evidently determines a partition of the database. The search of the database for the PCA inversion of spectro-polarimetric data can profit greatly from this indexing. In practical cases it becomes possible to approach the ideal acceleration factor of 24n\n as compared to the systematic search of a non-indexed database for a traditional PCA inversion. This indexing method relies on the existence of a physical meaning in the sign of the PCA coefficients of a model. For this reason, the presence of model ambiguities and of spectro-polarimetric noise in the observations limits in practice the number n of relevant PCA orders that can be used for the indexing.", "titre": "Improved Search of Principal Component Analysis Databases for Spectro-polarimetric Inversion", "type": "Journal article", "lienPDF": "/article/10.1088/0004-637X/773/2/180/pdf", "doi": "10.1088/0004-637X/773/2/180"}, {"authors": "J.

We perform two distinct searches: a modeled search for coalescences of either two neutron stars or a neutron star and black hole, and a search for generic, unmodeled gravitational-wave bursts. We find no evidence for gravitational-wave counterparts, either with any individual GRB in this sample or with the population as a whole. For all GRBs we place lower bounds on the distance to the progenitor, under the optimistic assumption of a gravitational-wave emission energy of 10–2 M\n☉ c\n2 at 150 Hz, with a median limit of 17 Mpc. For short-hard GRBs we place exclusion distances on binary neutron star and neutron-star-black-hole progenitors, using astrophysically motivated priors on the source parameters, with median values of 16 Mpc and 28 Mpc, respectively. These distance limits, while significantly larger than for a search that is not aided by GRB satellite observations, are not large enough to expect a coincidence with a GRB.

A total sky area of 2.66 deg2, spread over 141 fields at low Galactic latitudes (b6-8 deg), was observed 16 times with a cadence that was chosen to sample timescales of days, months, and years. Most of the data were reduced, analyzed, and searched for transients in near real-time. Interesting candidates were followed up using visible light telescopes (typical delays of 1-2 hr) and the X-ray Telescope on board the Swift satellite. The final processing of the data revealed a single possible transient with a peak flux density of f\nν2.4 mJy. This implies a transient's sky surface density of κ(f\nν > 1.8 mJy) = 0.039+0.13, +0.18\n– 0.032, –0.038 deg–2 (1σ, 2σ confidence errors). This areal density is roughly consistent with the sky surface density of transients from the Bower et al. survey extrapolated to 1.8 mJy. Our observed transient areal density is consistent with a neutron star's origin for these events. Furthermore, we use the data to measure the source variability on timescales of days to years, and we present the variability structure function of 5 GHz sources. The mean structure function shows a fast increase on ≈1 day timescale, followed by a slower increase on timescales of up to 10 days. On timescales between 10 and 60 days, the structure function is roughly constant. We find that  30% of the unresolved sources brighter than 1.8 mJy are variables at the >4σ confidence level, presumably mainly due to refractive scintillation.", "titre": "A Very Large Array Search for 5 GHz Radio Transients and Variables at Low Galactic Latitudes", "type": "Journal article", "lienPDF": "/article/10.1088/0004-637X/740/2/65/pdf", "doi": "10.1088/0004-637X/740/2/65"}, {"authors": "Steven Lowette", "annee": "2016", "resume": "A review is given of the current status of searches for dark matter at accelerators.

For this search, ephemerides overlapping the run period were obtained for all pulsars using radio and X-ray observations. We demonstrate an updated search method that allows for small uncertainties in the pulsar phase parameters to be included in the search. We report no signal detection from any of the targets and therefore interpret our results as upper limits on the gravitational wave signal strength. The most interesting limits are those for young pulsars. We present updated limits on gravitational radiation from the Crab pulsar, where the measured limit is now a factor of 7 below the spin-down limit. This limits the power radiated via gravitational waves to be less than ~2% of the available spin-down power. For the X-ray pulsar J0537 – 6910 we reach the spin-down limit under the assumption that any gravitational wave signal from it stays phase locked to the X-ray pulses over timing glitches, and for pulsars J1913+1011 and J1952+3252 we are only a factor of a few above the spin-down limit. Of the recycled millisecond pulsars, several of the measured upper limits are only about an order of magnitude above their spin-down limits. For these our best (lowest) upper limit on gravitational wave amplitude is 2.3 × 10–26 for J1603 – 7202 and our best (lowest) limit on the inferred pulsar ellipticity is 7.0 × 10–8 for J2124 – 3358.", "titre": "Searches for Gravitational Waves from Known Pulsars with Science Run 5 LIGO Data", "type": "Journal article", "lienPDF": "/article/10.1088/0004-637X/713/1/671/pdf", "doi": "10.1088/0004-637X/713/1/671"}, {"authors": "Fronefield Crawford, Jason W.

Deep observations were conducted at 1.4 GHz in 1999 July and August with the Parkes 64 m telescope. For all of the target AXPs, the upper limits on integrated pulsed emission are ~0.02 mJy, while the limits on the flux of single pulses are ~1 Jy or better. The corresponding radio luminosity limits are significantly below the observed luminosities of the majority of the observed radio pulsars, and they are significantly below the radio luminosity of XTE J1810-197, the only AXP known thus far to emit radio pulsations, at the epoch when radio pulses were first detected from this source. Our null results support the hypothesis that pulsed radio emission from AXPs is only present in conjunction with X-ray outburst activity. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that pulsed radio emission is present, but that it is too weak to be detected in our observations, or that unfavorable viewing geometries prevent this emission from being seen by terrestrial observers. Given the possible association between the radio emission and transient X-ray behavior of XTE J1810-197, continued radio searches of these and other AXPs at different epochs are warranted, particularly after periods of X-ray burst activity.", "titre": "Deep Searches for Radio Pulsations and Bursts from Four Southern Anomalous X-Ray Pulsars", "type": "Journal article", "lienPDF": "/article/10.1086/517991/pdf", "doi": "10.1086/517991"}, {"authors": "Alaina L.

These images reach 5σ sensitivities of J\n110 = 26.0-27.5 (AB), and combined they increase the amount of deep near-infrared data by more than 60% in fields where the investment in deep optical data has already been made.

For a blind search, semi-empirical luminosity functions are used to calculate the number of galaxies whose expected flux densities exceed an assumed detectability threshold. Plots of the minimum sky area, within which at least one detectable galaxy is expected at a given observing frequency, in the fiducial instantaneous passband of 104 km s–1, allow us to assess the blind search time necessary for detection by a given facility. We show that the chances for detection are the highest in the millimeter and submillimeter domains, but finding spontaneous emission in a blind search, especially from redshifts z  1, is a challenge even with powerful facilities, such as the Actama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array and Square Kilometre Array.

50–1000 Hz with the first derivative of frequency in the range −8.9 × 10−10 Hz s−1 to zero in two years of data collected during LIGO's fifth science run. Our results employ a Hough transform technique, introducing a χ2 test and analysis of coincidences between the signal levels in years 1 and 2 of observations that offers a significant improvement in the product of strain sensitivity with compute cycles per data sample compared to previously published searches. Since our search yields no surviving candidates, we present results taking the form of frequency dependent, 95% confidence upper limits on the strain amplitude h0. The most stringent upper limit from year 1 is 1.0 × 10−24 in the 158.00–158.25 Hz band. In year 2, the most stringent upper limit is 8.9 × 10−25 in the 146.50–146.75 Hz band.

A total of 15,366 GRPs were recorded during 11.6 hr of simultaneous observations, which were made across four nights in 2008 December and in 2009 November and December. We searched for an enhancement of the pulsed gamma-ray emission within time windows placed around the arrival time of the GRP events. In total, eight different time windows with durations ranging from 0.033 ms to 72 s were positioned at three different locations relative to the GRP to search for enhanced gamma-ray emission which lagged, led, or was concurrent with, the GRP event. Furthermore, we performed separate searches on main pulse GRPs and interpulse GRPs and on the most energetic GRPs in our data sample. No significant enhancement of pulsed VHE emission was found in any of the preformed searches. We set upper limits of 5-10 times the average VHE flux of the Crab pulsar on the flux simultaneous with interpulse GRPs on single-rotation-period timescales. On ~8 s timescales around interpulse GRPs, we set an upper limit of 2-3 times the average VHE flux.

Our data set includes ~23 arcmin2 of deep NICMOS J + H data and ~248 arcmin2 of ground-based (ISAAC+MOIRCS) data, coincident with ACS optical data of greater or equal depths. In total, we find eight  ~ 7.3 z-dropouts in our search fields, but no z ~ 9 J-dropout candidates. A careful consideration of a wide variety of different contaminants suggest an overall contamination level of just ~12% for our z-dropout selection. After performing detailed simulations to accurately estimate the selection volumes, we derive constraints on the UV LFs at z ~ 7 and z ~ 9. For a faint-end slope α  =  − 1.74, our most likely values for MUV* and * at z ~ 7 are –19.8 ± 0.4 mag and 1.1+ 1.7−0.7 × 10−3 Mpc−3, respectively. Our search results for z ~ 9 J-dropouts set a 1 σ lower limit on MUV* of –19.6 mag assuming that * and α are the same as their values at slightly later times. This lower limit on MUV* is 1.4 mag fainter than our best-fit value at z ~ 4, suggesting that the UV LF has undergone substantial evolution over this time period. No evolution is ruled out at 99% confidence from z ~ 7 to z ~ 6 and at 80% confidence from z ~ 9 to z ~ 7. We find that the mass-to-light ratio of halos evolves as ~(1 + z)−1 if we require that the observed brightening in MUV* with redshift [i.e., MUV* = (− 21.02 ± 0.09)  + (0.36 ± 0.08) (z − 3.8) ] be consistent with the expected evolution in the halo mass function.

However, studies attempting to confirm this possibility have been inconclusive. To refine the search for these objects, Baumgardt et al. completed a series of N-body simulations to determine the observational properties that a host globular cluster should possess. Keys to revealing the presence of an IMBH were found to be the shape of the cluster's core proper motion dispersion profile and its surface density profile. Among the possible host clusters identified by Baumgardt et al., NGC 6266 was found to be the most suitable object to search. Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 images with an epoch difference of eight years were, therefore, used to measure this cluster's internal proper motion dispersion profile from 0.8 arcsec to 17 arcsec from the cluster center. This profile and the surface density profiles obtained by Noyola & Gebhardt and Trager et al. were then compared to those produced by N-body simulations of NGC 6266 with and without an IMBH. We find that a centrally located IMBH is not required to match these profiles, but that an IMBH with a 1σ upper limit mass of less than a few thousand M\n☉ cannot be excluded. To establish the existence of this object, the exact location of the density center and more precise velocity measurements within the inner 1 arcsec of this center are required. Our best-fitting model of NGC 6266 without an IMBH yields a cluster mass of M = 8.22 ± 0.17 × 105\nM\n☉, leading to a mass-to-light ratio of M/LV\n = 2.05 ± 0.04.", "titre": "A Search for an Intermediate-mass Black Hole in the Core of the Globular Cluster NGC 6266", "type": "Journal article", "lienPDF": "/article/10.1088/0004-637X/745/2/175/pdf", "doi": "10.1088/0004-637X/745/2/175"}, {"authors": "M.

Given the increasing availability of high-resolution observation data, statistical inference for search paths based on such high-resolution data has recently become one of the major interests and has raised an important issue of robustness of random walk models to the sampling rate, as estimation results for the discrete observation data are found to be largely different at different sampling rates even when the underlying movement is supposedly independent of scale. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose to model the continuous-time search paths directly with a continuous-time stochastic process for which the observer makes statistical inference based on its discrete observation. As continuous-time counterparts of Lévy flights, we consider two-dimensional Lévy processes and discuss the relevance of those models based upon advantages and limitations in terms of statistical properties and inference. Among the proposed models, the Brownian motion is most tractable in various ways while its Gaussianity and infinite variation of sample paths do not well describe the reality.

The recent localization of the source of the X-ray emission has made a targeted search for radio pulsations from this source possible. The detection of pulsed radio emission from XTE J0103–728 would make it only the second system after PSR B1259–63 that is both a Be/X-ray binary and a radio pulsar. We observed XTE J0103–728 in 2008 February with the Parkes 64 m radio telescope soon after the identification of the source of X-ray pulsations was reported in order to search for corresponding radio pulsations. We used a continuous 6.4 hr observation with a 256 MHz bandwidth centered at 1390 MHz using the center beam of the Parkes multibeam receiver. In the subsequent data analysis, which included a folding search, a Fourier search, a fast-folding algorithm search, and a single pulse search, no pulsed signals were found for trial dispersion measures (DMs) between 0 and 800 pc cm–3. This DM range easily encompasses the expected values for sources in the SMC. We place an upper limit of ~45 mJy kpc2 on the luminosity of periodic radio emission from XTE J0103–728 at the epoch of our observation, and we compare this limit to a range of luminosities measured for PSR B1259–63, the only Be/X-ray binary currently known to emit radio pulses.

Unlike most known eclipsing systems of this type, the optical and infrared emission is dominated by the M-dwarf components, and the systems have optical colors and discovery light curves consistent with being Jupiter-radius transiting planets around early M-dwarfs. We detail the PTF/M-dwarf transiting planet survey, part of the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF). We present a graphics processing unit (GPU)-based box-least-squares search for transits that runs approximately 8 × faster than similar algorithms implemented on general purpose systems. For the discovered systems, we decompose low-resolution spectra of the systems into white-dwarf and M-dwarf components, and use radial velocity measurements and cooling models to estimate masses and radii for the white dwarfs. The systems are compact, with periods between 0.35 and 0.45 days and semimajor axes of approximately 2 R\n☉ (0.01 AU). The M-dwarfs have masses of approximately 0.35 M\n☉, and the white dwarfs have hydrogen-rich atmospheres with temperatures of around 8000 K and have masses of approximately 0.5 M\n☉. We use the Robo-AO laser guide star adaptive optics system to tentatively identify one of the objects as a triple system. We also use high-cadence photometry to put an upper limit on the white-dwarf radius of 0.025 R\n☉ (95% confidence) in one of the systems. Accounting for our detection efficiency and geometric factors, we estimate that  (90% confidence) of M-dwarfs are in these short-period, post-common-envelope white-dwarf/M-dwarf binaries where the optical light is dominated by the M-dwarf. The lack of detections at shorter periods, despite near-100% detection efficiency for such systems, suggests that binaries including these relatively low-temperature white dwarfs are preferentially found at relatively large orbital radii. Similar eclipsing binary systems can have arbitrarily small eclipse depths in red bands and generate plausible small-planet-transit light curves. As such, these systems are a source of false positives for M-dwarf transiting planet searches.

However, with only three giant flares ever recorded, and only two with data of sufficient quality to search for QPOs, such analysis is seriously data limited. We set out a procedure for doing QPO searches in the far more numerous, short, less energetic magnetar bursts. The short, transient nature of these bursts requires the implementation of sophisticated statistical techniques to make reliable inferences. Using Bayesian statistics, we model the periodogram as a combination of red noise at low frequencies and white noise at high frequencies, which we show is a conservative approach to the problem. We use empirical models to make inferences about the potential signature of periodic and QPOs at these frequencies.

We illustrate our Bayesian method by applying it to a sample of 27 bursts from the magnetar SGR J0501+4516 observed by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor, and we find no evidence for the presence of QPOs in any of the bursts in the unbinned spectra, but do find a candidate detection in the binned spectra of one burst.

This is followed by a fast second stage in which areas in frequency space are identified as signal candidates through the frequency domain convolution of the -statistic with an approximate signal template. For this second stage only precise information on the orbit period and approximate information on the orbital semi-major axis are required a priori. For the final stage we propose a fully coherent Markov chain Monte Carlo based follow-up search on the frequency subspace defined by the candidates identified by the second stage. This search is particularly suited to the low-mass x-ray binaries, for which orbital period and sky position are typically well known and additional orbital parameters and neutron star spin frequency are not. We note that for the accreting x-ray millisecond pulsars, for which spin frequency and orbital parameters are well known, the second stage can be omitted and the fully coherent search stage can be performed.

In addition, we present the first results from an all-sky search for extended sources of neutrinos. We update the results of searches for neutrino emission from stacked catalogs of sources and test five new catalogs; two of Galactic supernova remnants and three of active galactic nuclei.

The pulsars were found with a novel hierarchical search method originally developed for detecting continuous gravitational waves from rapidly rotating neutron stars. Designed to find isolated pulsars spinning at up to kHz frequencies, the new method is computationally efficient and incorporates several advances, including a metric-based gridding of the search parameter space (frequency, frequency derivative, and sky location) and the use of photon probability weights. The nine pulsars have spin frequencies between 3 and 12 Hz, and characteristic ages ranging from 17 kyr to 3 Myr. Two of them, PSRs J1803-2149 and J2111+ 4606, are young and energetic Galactic-plane pulsars (spin-down power above 6 × 1035 erg s–1 and ages below 100 kyr).

PSR J0106+4855 has the largest characteristic age (3 Myr) and the smallest surface magnetic field (2 × 1011 G) of all LAT blind-search pulsars. PSR J2139+4716 has the lowest spin-down power (3 × 1033 erg s–1) among all non-recycled gamma-ray pulsars ever found.

The targets were nine young supernova remnants not associated with pulsars; eight of the remnants are associated with non-pulsing suspected neutron stars. One target's parameters are uncertain enough to warrant two searches, for a total of 10. Each search covered a broad band of frequencies and first and second frequency derivatives for a fixed sky direction. The searches coherently integrated data from the two LIGO interferometers over time spans from 5.3–25.3 days using the matched-filtering -statistic. We found no evidence of GW signals. We set 95% confidence upper limits as strong (low) as 4 × 10−25 on intrinsic strain, 2 × 10−7 on fiducial ellipticity, and 4 × 10−5 on r-mode amplitude. These beat the indirect limits from energy conservation and are within the range of theoretical predictions for neutron-star ellipticities and r-mode amplitudes.", "titre": "Searches for Continuous Gravitational Waves from Nine Young Supernova Remnants", "type": "Journal article", "lienPDF": "/article/10.1088/0004-637X/813/1/39/pdf", "doi": "10.1088/0004-637X/813/1/39"}, {"authors": "Jean-Michel Désert, Alain Lecavelier des Etangs, Guillaume Hébrard, David K.

Atmospheric models for these planets predict that the strongest spectrophotometric features of those molecules are located at wavelengths ranging from 1 to 10 μm  making this region of particular interest. Consequently, transit observations in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) allow the atmospheric content of transiting planets to be determined. We present new primary transit observations of the hot-Jupiter HD 189733b, obtained simultaneously at 4.5 and 8 μm with the Infrared Array Camera onboard the Spitzer\nSpace Telescope. Together with a new refined analysis of previous observations at 3.6 and 5.8 μm using the same instrument, we are able to derive the system parameters, including planet-to-star radius ratio, impact parameter, scale of the system, and central time of the transit from fits of the transit light curves at these four wavelengths. We measure the four planet-to-star radius ratios, to be (Rp\n/R\n)3.6 μm = 0.1545 ± 0.0003, (Rp\n/R\n)4.5 μm = 0.1557 ± 0.0003, (Rp\n/R\n)5.8 μm = 0.1547 ± 0.0005, and (Rp\n/R\n)8 μm = 0.1544 ± 0.0004. The high accuracy of the planet radii measurement allows the search for atmospheric molecular absorbers. Contrary to a previous analysis of the same data set, our study is robust against systematics and reveals that water vapor absorption at 5.8 μm is not detected in this photometric data set. Furthermore, in the band centered around 4.5 μm we find a hint of excess absorption with an apparent planetary radius ΔRp\n/R\n* =  0.00128 ± 0.00056 larger (2.3σ) than the one measured simultaneously at 8 μm. This value is 4σ above what would be expected for an atmosphere where water vapor is the only absorbing species in the near-IR. This shows that an additional species absorbing around 4.5 μm could be present in the atmosphere. Carbon monoxide (CO) being a strong absorber at this wavelength is a possible candidate and this may suggest a large CO/H2O ratio between 5 and 60.", "titre": "Search for Carbon Monoxide in the Atmosphere of the Transiting Exoplanet HD 189733b", "type": "Journal article", "lienPDF": "/article/10.1088/0004-637X/699/1/478/pdf", "doi": "10.1088/0004-637X/699/1/478"}]
