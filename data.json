TFs search for their DNA promoter target by alternating between bulk diffusion and sliding along the DNA, a mechanism known as facilitated diffusion. We study a facilitated diffusion framework with switching between three search modes: a bulk mode and two sliding modes triggered by conformational changes between two protein conformations. In one conformation (search mode) the TF interacts unspecifically with the DNA backbone resulting in fast sliding. In the other conformation (recognition mode) it interacts specifically and strongly with DNA base pairs leading to slow displacement. From the bulk, a TF associates with the DNA at a random position that is correlated with the previous dissociation point, which implicitly is a function of the DNA structure. The target affinity depends on the conformation. We derive exact expressions for the mean first passage time (MFPT) to bind to the promoter and the conditional probability to bind before detaching when arriving at the promoter site. We systematically explore the parameter space and compare various search scenarios. We compare our results with experimental data for the dimeric Lac repressor search in E. coli bacteria. We find that a coiled DNA conformation is absolutely necessary for a fast MFPT.

They detected the emission of non-thermal radiation that they were searching for, but were surprised that it contained spectral peaks suggesting modulation at various frequencies and their harmonics. Ruf et al. hypothesized that the emission of non-thermal radiation was caused by electric discharges in a deep convective dust storm, modulated by Schumann resonances (SRs).

They stated that they found only radio frequency interference (RFI) during their search for non-thermal emission by martian dust storms and implicitly suggested that the signal detected by Ruf et al. was also RFI. However, their search was not conducted during the dust storm season when deep convective storms are most likely to occur. Here, we show that the ubiquitous dust devils and small-scale dust storms that were instead likely present during their observations are too shallow to excite SRs and produce the signals detected by Ruf et al.

Who hasn't gone through this experience when\nleaving, in a hurry, to attend to some urgent matter?  The keys could\nbe in many different places.  Unless one remembers where he or she has\nleft the keys, the only solution is to look around, more or less randomly.\nRandom searches are common because in many cases the locations of the\nspecific targets are not known  a priori. Indeed, such problems have been\ndiscussed in diverse contexts, attracting the interest of scientists from\nmany fields, for example: the dynamical or stochastic search for a stable\nminimum in a complex energy landscape, relevant to systems such as \nglasses,\nprotein (folding), and others; oil recovery from mature reservoirs; \nproteins\nsearching for their specific target sites on DNA; animal foraging; \nsurvival\nat the edge of extinction due to low availability of energetic resources;\nautomated searches of registers in high-capacity databases, search engine\n(e.g., `crawlers') that explore the internet; and even pizza delivery in\na jammed traffic system of a medium-size town. In this way, the subject is\ninteresting, challenging and has recently become an important scientific\narea of investigation.\nAlthough the applications are diverse, the underlying physical mechanisms\nare the same which will become clear in this special issue. \nMoreover,\nthe inherent complexity of the problem, the abundance of ideas and \nmethods\nfound in this growing interdisciplinary field of research is studied in\nmany areas of physics. In particular, the concepts and methods of \nstatistical\nmechanics are particularly useful to the study of random searches. On\none hand, it centres on how to find the global or local maxima of search\nefficiency functions with incomplete information. This is, of course, \nrelated\nto the long tradition in physics of using different conceptual and \nmathematical\ntools, such as variational methods, to extremize relevant quantities, e.g., \nenergy,\nentropy and action. Such ideas and approaches are very important to solve\ncomputationally complex problems (e.g., protein folding), which involve\noptimizations in very high dimensional energy landscapes. On the other \nhand,\nrandom searches can also be studied from the perspective of diffusion and\ntransport properties which is an important topic in condensed matter and \nstatistical\nphysics. For instance, the features of light scattered in a \nmedia,\nwhere the scatterers have a power-law distribution of sizes in many \naspects,\nmay resemble the patterns generated by a searcher performing Lévy walks.\nThere are many questions related to random searches: how the searcher\nmoves or should move, what are the patterns generated during the\nlocomotion, how do the encounter rates depend on parameters of the\nsearch, etc. But perhaps, the most well known issue is how\nto optimize the search for specific target scenarios. The optimization\ncan be in either continuous or discrete environments, when the information\navailable is limited. The answer to this question determines specific\nstrategies of movement that would maximize some properly defined\nsearch efficiency measure. The relevance of the question stems from the\nfact that the strategy-dynamics represents one of the most important \nfactors\nthat modulate the rate of encounters (e.g., the encounter rate between\npredator and prey).  In the general context, strategy choices can be\nessential in determining the outcome and thus the success of a given\nsearch. For instance, realistic searches—and locomotion in\ngeneral—require the expenditure of energy. Thus, inefficient search\ncould deplete energy reserves (e.g., fat) and lead to rates of\nencounters below a minimum acceptable threshold (resulting in extinction\nof a species, for example).\nThe framework of the random search `game' distinguishes between the\ntwo interacting players in a context of pursuit and chance. They are\neither a `searcher' (e.g., predator, protein, radar, `crawler') or a `target' (e.g., prey, DNA sequence, a missing aircraft,\na given web site). Regarding the nature of the searching drive, in\ncertain instances, it can be guided almost entirely by external cues,\neither by the cognitive (memory) or detective (olfaction, vision, etc)\nskills of the searcher. However, in many situations the movement is\nnon-oriented, being in essence a stochastic process. Therefore, in\nsuch cases (and even when a small deterministic component in the\nlocomotion exists) a random search effectively defines the final rates\nof encounters.\nHence, one reason underlying the richness of the random search problem\nrelates just to the `ignorance' of the locations of the randomly\nlocated targets. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the lack of complete\ninformation does not necessarily lead to greater complexity. As an\nillustrative example, let us consider the case of complete information.\nIf the positions of all target sites are known in advance, then the\nquestion of what sequential order to visit the sites so to reduce the\nenergy costs of locomotion itself becomes a rather challenging problem:\nthe famous `travelling salesman' optimization query, belonging to\nthe NP-complete class of problems. The ignorance of the target site\nlocations, however, considerably modifies the problem and renders\nit not amenable to be treated by purely deterministic computational\nmethods. In fact, as expected, the random search problem is not\nparticularly suited to search algorithms that do not use elements\nof randomness.\nSo, only a statistical approach to the search problem can adequately deal\nwith the element of ignorance. In other words, the incomplete information renders the search under-determined, i.e.,\nit is not possible to find the `best' solution to the problem because\nall the information is not given. Instead, one must guess and \nprobabilistic\nor stochastic strategies become unavoidable. Also, the random search\nproblem bears a relation to reaction–diffusion processes, because the\nsearch involves a diffusive aspect, movement, as well as a reactive\ncomponent, e.g., eating, mating, etc.\nFrom the comments above, it is clear that the subject can be treated\nfrom the perspective of different fields and subfields of physics and\nmathematics: statistical mechanics, stochastic processes, Lévy walks\nand flights, complex systems, fractal geometry, and non-linear\nphenomena. Some important questions in random searches, especially in\nthe case of discrete landscapes, are also associated with graph\ntheory, random lattices, and complex networks.\nThe aim of this special issue is to bring together, in a single \npublication,\nall or most of the relevant theoretical concepts–ideas together with \ndiscussions\nof recent findings that are important for understanding the main elements \nof\nrandom searches.

data in coincidence with the LIGO and GEO gravitational-wave (GW) detectors. These data have been searched for GWs emitted by cataclysmic phenomena in the universe, by non-axisymmetric rotating neutron stars or from a stochastic background in the frequency band of the detectors. The sensitivity of GW searches is limited by noise produced by the detector or its environment. It is therefore crucial to characterize the various noise sources in a GW detector. This paper reviews the Virgo detector noise sources, noise propagation, and conversion mechanisms which were identified in the three first Virgo observing runs. In many cases, these investigations allowed us to mitigate noise sources in the detector, or to selectively flag noise events and discard them from the data. We present examples from the joint LIGO-GEO-Virgo GW searches to show how well noise transients and narrow spectral lines have been identified and excluded from the Virgo data. We also discuss how detector characterization can improve the astrophysical reach of GW searches.", "Titre": "The characterization of Virgo data and its impact on gravitational-wave searches", "Type": "Journal article", "LienPDF": "/article/10.1088/0264-9381/29/15/155002/pdf", "doi": "10.1088/0264-9381/29/15/155002"}, {"Id": 19, "Autheur": "N.

Data were searched for both periodic and aperiodic sources, up to 1000 pc cm–3  in dispersion measure and on timescales from ~50 μs  to several seconds. The galaxy was sampled with 12 ALFA pointings, or 84 pixels in total, each of which was searched for 2-3 hr. We describe the observations, search methodologies, and analysis strategies applicable to multibeam systems, and comment on the data quality and statistics of spurious events that arise due to radio frequency interference. While these searches have not led to any conclusive signals of periodic or transient nature that originate in the galaxy, they illustrate some of the underlying challenges and difficulties in such searches and the efficacy of simultaneous multiple beams in the analysis of search output. The implied limits are 5 μJy Mpc2  in luminosity (at 1400 MHz) for periodic sources in M33 with duty cycles 5%. For short-duration transient signals (with pulse widths 100 μs ), the limiting peak flux density is 100 mJy, which would correspond to a 5σ detection of bright giant pulses (~20 kJy) from Crab-like pulsars if located at the distance of M33.

Data were collected using the partially completed IceCube detector in the 40-string configuration recorded between 2008 April 5 and 2009 May 20, totaling 375.5 days livetime. An unbinned maximum likelihood ratio method is used to search for astrophysical signals. The data sample contains 36,900 events: 14,121 from the northern sky, mostly muons induced by atmospheric neutrinos, and 22,779 from the southern sky, mostly high-energy atmospheric muons. The analysis includes searches for individual point sources and stacked searches for sources in a common class, sometimes including a spatial extent. While this analysis is sensitive to TeV-PeV energy neutrinos in the northern sky, it is primarily sensitive to neutrinos with energy greater than about 1 PeV in the southern sky. No evidence for a signal is found in any of the searches. Limits are set for neutrino fluxes from astrophysical sources over the entire sky and compared to predictions. The sensitivity is at least a factor of two better than previous searches (depending on declination), with 90% confidence level muon neutrino flux upper limits being between E\n2\ndΦ/dE ~ 2-200 × 10–12 TeV cm–2 s–1 in the northern sky and between 3-700 × 10–12 TeV cm–2 s–1 in the southern sky.

We investigate in particular our sensitivity to additional transits in the dynamically favorable 3:2 and 2:1 exterior resonances with the known exoplanets: if we assume coplanar orbits with the known planets, then companions in these resonances with HAT-P-4b, WASP-3b, and HAT-P-7b would be expected to transit, and we can set lower limits on the radii of companions in these systems. In the nearly grazing exoplanetary systems TrES-3 and TrES-2, additional coplanar planets in these resonances are not expected to transit.

Finally, motivated by an accumulation of seven events relatively close to the Galactic Center in the recently reported neutrino sample of the IceCube telescope, a search for point sources in a broad region around this accumulation has been carried out. No indication of a neutrino signal has been found in the ANTARES data and upper limits on the flux normalization of an E\n–2 energy spectrum of neutrinos from point sources in that region have been set. The 90% confidence level upper limits on the muon neutrino flux normalization vary between 3.5 and 5.1 × 10–8 GeV cm–2 s–1, depending on the exact location of the source.", "Titre": "Searches for Point-like and Extended Neutrino Sources Close to the Galactic Center Using the ANTARES Neutrino Telescope", "Type": "Journal article", "LienPDF": "/article/10.1088/2041-8205/786/1/L5/pdf", "doi": "10.1088/2041-8205/786/1/L5"}, {"Id": 23, "Autheur": "Uttam Bhat, Caterina De Bacco and S Redner", "Annee": "2016", "Resume": "We investigate a stochastic search process in one, two, and three dimensions in which N diffusing searchers that all start at x\n0 seek a target at the origin.

The beam angle optimization (BAO) in intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) consists of selecting appropriate radiation incidence directions and may influence the quality of the IMRT plans, both to enhance better organ sparing and to improve tumor coverage. However, in clinical practice, most of the time, beam directions continue to be manually selected by the treatment planner without objective and rigorous criteria. The goal of this paper is to introduce a novel approach that uses beam's-eye-view dose ray tracing metrics within a pattern search method framework in the optimization of the highly non-convex BAO problem. Pattern search methods are derivative-free optimization methods that require a few function evaluations to progress and converge and have the ability to better avoid local entrapment. The pattern search method framework is composed of a search step and a poll step at each iteration. The poll step performs a local search in a mesh neighborhood and ensures the convergence to a local minimizer or stationary point. The search step provides the flexibility for a global search since it allows searches away from the neighborhood of the current iterate. Beam's-eye-view dose metrics assign a score to each radiation beam direction and can be used within the pattern search framework furnishing a priori knowledge of the problem so that directions with larger dosimetric scores are tested first. A set of clinical cases of head-and-neck tumors treated at the Portuguese Institute of Oncology of Coimbra is used to discuss the potential of this approach in the optimization of the BAO problem.", "Titre": "Beam angle optimization for intensity-modulated radiation therapy using a guided pattern search method", "Type": "Journal article", "LienPDF": "/article/10.1088/0031-9155/58/9/2939/pdf", "doi": "10.1088/0031-9155/58/9/2939"}, {"Id": 27, "Autheur": "Weiwei Zhu and Victoria M.

We searched for microvariability on 33 nights. Strong evidence for microvariability was found only for our lowest luminosity object, NGC 4051, on one night. Weaker evidence suggests such variability on a few other nights for two other objects, but the data are not as convincing. Intranight variability in NLS1's is thus concluded to be rare and of low amplitude. We give illustrations of how variable image quality can produce spurious variability. We find that for well-studied non-NLS1's there is a spread in the amplitude of seasonal variability (i.e., in some years an active galactic nucleus [AGN] is more variable than in others). We find that the means of the variability amplitudes of non-NLS1's over several seasons vary from object to object (i.e., some AGNs are, on average, more variable than others). NLS1's also show a spread in seasonal variabilities. The best-studied NLS1, Ark 564, shows a range of amplitudes of variability from season to season that is comparable to the range found in broad-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (BLS1's), and in one season Ark 564 was as variable as the most variable non-NLS1. The seasonal amplitudes of variability for NLS1's are mostly in the lower half of the range of non-BLS1 seasonal amplitudes, but the absence of a suitable control sample makes a precise comparison difficult. However, on long timescales (weeks to years) NLS1's as a class are not more variable than non-NLS1's. The extreme variability seen in the X-rays was not seen in the optical.

For the first time, a search is performed over the entire parameter space of energy, direction, and time with sensitivity to neutrino flares lasting between 20 μs and a year duration from astrophysical sources. Searches that integrate over time are less sensitive to flares because they are affected by a larger background of atmospheric neutrinos and muons that can be reduced by the use of additional timing information. Flaring sources considered here, such as active galactic nuclei, soft gamma-ray repeaters, and gamma-ray bursts, are promising candidate neutrino emitters. Two searches are \"untriggered\" in the sense that they look for any possible flare in the entire sky and from a predefined catalog of sources from which photon flares have been recorded. The other two searches are triggered by multi-wavelength information on flares from blazars and from a soft gamma-ray repeater. One triggered search uses lightcurves from Fermi-LAT which provides continuous monitoring. A second triggered search uses information where the flux states have been measured only for short periods of time near the flares. The untriggered searches use data taken by 40 strings of IceCube between 2008 April 5 and 2009 May 20.

We find that higher criticism on -statistic data is more sensitive by ~6% than the -statistic alone under optimal conditions (i.e., binary orbit known exactly) and the relative advantage increases as the error in the orbital parameters increases. Higher criticism is robust even when the source is not monochromatic (e.g., phase-wandering in an accreting system). Applying higher criticism to a phase-wandering source over multiple time intervals gives a  30% increase in detectability with few assumptions about the frequency evolution.

In particular, technology now available on Earth could be used to send signals having the required energy to be detected at a target located 1000 lt-yr away.

Contributions from these multiple channels to the overall experimental sensitivity (cross-section times branching ratio) are model-independent and can be parametrized in terms of relevant new particle masses. Given the trileptonic branching ratios of a specific model, these experimentally obtained multi-channel sensitivities can be combined to obtain a cross-section measurement that can be used to confront the model with data. Our model-independent results are more widely applicable than the current Tevatron trilepton results which are stated exclusively in terms of mSUGRA parameters of supersymmetry.

The majority of the latter WDs are central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPNs). We have therefore used archival Spitzer Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) and Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS) observations of PNs to search for CSPNs with IR excesses and to make a comparative investigation of dust disks around stars at different evolutionary stages. We have examined available images of 72 resolved PNs in the Spitzer archive and found 56 of them large enough for the CSPN to be resolved from the PN. Among these, only 42 CSPNs are visible in IRAC and/or MIPS images and selected for photometric measurements. From the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of these CSPNs, we find 19 cases with clear IR excess. Of these, seven are [WC]-type stars, two have apparent visual companions that account for the observed excess emission, two are symbiotic CSPNs, and in eight cases the IR excess originates from an extended emitter, likely a dust disk. For some of these CSPNs, we have acquired follow-up Spitzer MIPS images, Infrared Spectrograph spectra, and Gemini NIRI and Michelle spectroscopic observations. The SEDs and spectra show a great diversity in the emission characteristics of the IR excesses, which may imply different mechanisms responsible for the excess emission. For CSPNs whose IR excesses originate from dust continuum, the most likely dust production mechanisms are (1) breakup of bodies in planetesimal belts through collisions and (2) formation of circumstellar dust disks through binary interactions. A better understanding of post-asymptotic giant branch binary evolution as well as debris disk evolution along with its parent star is needed to distinguish between these different origins.

This search has been performed by modeling both the Kepler pre-search data conditioned light curves and new light curves produced via our own photometric pipeline. We derive new stellar and planetary parameters for each system, while calculating robust errors for both. We find 16 systems with 1σ-2σ, 14 systems with 2σ-3σ, and 6 systems with >3σ confidence level secondary eclipse detections in at least one light curve produced via the Kepler pre-search data conditioned light curve or our own pipeline; however, results can vary depending on the light curve modeled and whether eccentricity is allowed to vary or not. We estimate false alarm probabilities of 31%, 10%, and 6% for the 1σ-2σ, 2σ-3σ, and >3σ confidence intervals, respectively. Comparing each secondary eclipse result to theoretical expectations, we find that the majority of detected planet candidates emit more light than expected owing to thermal blackbody emission in the optical Kepler bandpass, and present a trend of increasing excess emission with decreasing maximum effective planetary temperature. These results agree with previously published optical secondary eclipse data for other hot Jupiters. We explore modeling biases, significant planetary albedos, non-local thermodynamic equilibrium or other thermal emission, significant internal energy generation, and misidentification of brown dwarfs, low-mass stars, or stellar blends as possible causes of both the excess emission and its correlation with expected planetary temperature. Although we find that no single cause is able to explain all of the planet candidates, significant planetary albedos, with a general trend of increasing planetary albedos with decreasing atmospheric temperatures, are able to explain most of the systems. Identifying systems that we deem likely to be low-mass stars or stellar blends, we estimate an 11% false-positive rate in the current Kepler planet candidate sample of hot Jupiters. We also establish robust upper limits on the eclipse depth for the remaining systems and find that the emission of a significant fraction of these systems is consistent with the planets having very low albedos, i.e., at least 30% of all systems have Ag\n < 0.3 at 1σ confidence levels. This result augments the current number of constrained exoplanetary albedos and extends the sample of low albedo determinations to planets with temperatures as low as 1200 K.

Careful visual inspection of all publicly available optical and ultraviolet imaging at the position of the UCHVCs revealed six blue, diffuse counterparts with a morphology consistent with a faint dwarf galaxy beyond the Local Group.

The physical interpretation for the FRBs remains unclear but is thought to involve highly compact objects at cosmological distance. It has been suggested that a fraction of FRBs could be physically associated with gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Recent radio observations of GRBs have reported the detection of two highly dispersed short duration radio pulses using a 12 m radio telescope at 1.4 GHz. Motivated by this result, we have performed a systematic and sensitive search for FRBs associated with GRBs. We have observed five GRBs at 2.3 GHz using a 26 m radio telescope located at the Mount Pleasant Radio Observatory, Hobart. The radio telescope was automated to rapidly respond to Gamma-ray Coordination Network notifications from the Swift satellite and slew to the GRB position within ~140 s. The data were searched for pulses up to 5000 pc cm–3 in dispersion measure and pulse widths ranging from 640 μs to 25.60 ms. We did not detect any events ≥6σ. An in depth statistical analysis of our data shows that events detected above 5σ are consistent with thermal noise fluctuations only.

In this second paper, we discuss an additional 39 stars observable from the southern hemisphere.

A new approach to the problem is presented, combining the analysis of arrival directions with the statistical test of the paired EAS samples. One of the ideas of the method is to search for possible correlations between UHECR masses and their separate sources; for instance, if there are two sources in different areas of the celestial sphere injecting different nuclei, but the fluxes are comparable so that arrival directions are isotropic, then the aim is to reveal a difference in the mass composition of cosmic-ray fluxes.

Two particular algorithms are proposed: first, using measurements of the depth of the EAS maximum position in the atmosphere; and second, relying on the age variance of air showers initiated by different primary particles.

Every transiting planet discovered will have a measured radius, which will provide constraints on planet composition, evolution, and migration history. Together with radial velocity measurements, the absolute mass of every transiting planet will be determined. In this paper we discuss the design considerations of the Extrasolar Planet Occultation Research (EXPLORE) project, a series of transiting planet searches using 4 m class telescopes to continuously monitor a single field of stars in the Galactic plane in each ~2 week observing campaign. We discuss the general factors that determine the efficiency and the number of planets found by a transit search, including time sampling strategy and field selection. The primary goal is to select the most promising planet candidates for radial velocity follow-up observations. We show that with very high photometric precision light curves that have frequent time sampling and at least two detected transits, it is possible to uniquely solve for the main parameters of the eclipsing system (including planet radius), based on several important assumptions about the central star. Together with a measured spectral type for the star, this unique solution for orbital parameters provides a powerful method for ruling out most contaminants to transiting planet candidates. For the EXPLORE project, radial velocity follow-up observations for companion mass determination of the best candidates are done on 8 m class telescopes within 2 or 3 months of the photometric campaigns. This same-season follow-up is made possible by the use of efficient pipelines to produce high-quality light curves within weeks of the observations. We conclude by presenting early results from our first search, EXPLORE I, in which we reached better than 1% rms photometric precision (measured over a full night) on ~37,000 stars with 14.5 ≤ I ≤ 18.2.", "Titre": "The EXPLORE Project.

The review begins with a summary of the expected model independent properties of primeval galaxies. Particular attention is paid to the redshift of galaxy formation; empirical evidence is presented that supports galaxy formation at z < 5; however, there exist persuasive arguments that at least some galaxy formation must have taken place at higher redshifts. A major part of this review concerns primeval galaxy search strategies. Most (although not all) constraints on the properties of primeval galaxies come from searches for Ly-alpha emitting objects. Flux limits for these searches have now reached levels at which surveys should, according to simple models, have detected a total of 101-3 objects; yet no really good candidates have been found. This discrepancy between models and observations can possibly be explained by a combination of (i) dust absorption, and (ii) finite angular extent, which degrades flux limits.

The targets of the search include 112,321 targets that were observed over the full interval and an additional 79,992 targets that were observed for a subset of the full interval. From this set of targets we find a total of 11,087 targets that contain at least one signal that meets the Kepler detection criteria: periodicity of the signal, an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio, and three tests that reject false positives. Each target containing at least one detected signal is then searched repeatedly for additional signals, which represent multi-planet systems of transiting planets. When targets with multiple detections are considered, a total of 18,406 potential transiting planet signals are found in the Kepler mission data set. The detected signals are dominated by events with relatively low signal-to-noise ratios and by events with relatively short periods. The distribution of estimated transit depths appears to peak in the range between 20 and 30 parts per million, with a few detections down to fewer than 10 parts per million. The detections exhibit signal-to-noise ratios from 7.1σ, which is the lower cutoff for detections, to over 10,000σ, and periods ranging from 0.5 days, which is the shortest period searched, to 525 days, which is the upper limit of achievable periods given the length of the data set and the requirement that all detections include at least three transits.

For each star, we report on variability, periodicity, and long-term velocity trends. Our sample of stars contains eight known companions with mass (Mp sin i) less than 8 Jupiter masses (MJ), six of which were discovered at Lick. For the remaining stars, we place upper limits on the companion mass as a function of orbital period. For most stars, we can exclude companions with velocity amplitude K  20 m s-1 at the 99% level, or Mp sin i  0.7MJ(a/AU)1/2 for orbital radii a  5 AU. We examine the implications of our results for the observed distribution of mass and orbital radius of companions. We show that the combination of intrinsic stellar variability and measurement errors most likely explains why all confirmed companions so far have K  40 m s-1. The finite duration of the observations limits detection of Jupiter-mass companions to a  3 AU. Thus it remains possible that the majority of solar-type stars harbor Jupiter-mass companions much like our own, and if so these companions should be detectable in a few years. It is striking that more massive companions with Mp sin i > 3MJ are rare at orbital radii 4-6 AU; we could have detected such objects in ~90% of stars, yet found none. The observed companions show a \"piling-up\" toward small orbital radii, and there is a paucity of confirmed and candidate companions with orbital radii between ~0.2 and ~1 AU. The small number of confirmed companions means that we are not able to rule out selection effects as the cause of these features. We show that the traditional method for detecting periodicities, the Lomb-Scargle periodogram, fails to account for statistical fluctuations in the mean of a sampled sinusoid, making it nonrobust when the number of observations is small, the sampling is uneven, or for periods comparable to or greater than the duration of the observations. We adopt a \"floating-mean\" periodogram, in which the zero point of the sinusoid is allowed to vary during the fit. We discuss in detail the normalization of the periodogram and the probability distribution of periodogram powers. We stress that the three different prescriptions in the literature for normalizing the periodogram are statistically equivalent and that it is not possible to write a simple analytic form for the false alarm probability, making Monte Carlo methods essential.", "Titre": "The Lick Planet Search: Detectability and Mass Thresholds", "Type": "Journal article", "LienPDF": "/article/10.1086/308020/pdf", "doi": "10.1086/308020"}, {"Id": 76, "Autheur": "Marco Chiaberge, Grant Tremblay, Alessandro Capetti, F.

In absence of spectroscopic redshift measurements, the selection method is based on multiple steps which make use of both radio and optical constraints. The basic assumptions are that (1) the break in radio power between low-power FR Is and the more powerful FR IIs does not change with redshift, and (2) that the photometric properties of the host galaxies of low-power radio galaxies in the distant universe are similar to those of FR IIs in the same redshift bin, as is the case for nearby radio galaxies. We describe the results of our search, which yields 37 low-power radio galaxy candidates that are possibly FR Is. We show that a large fraction of these low-luminosity radio galaxies display a compact radio morphology that does not correspond to the FR I morphological classification. Furthermore, our objects are apparently associated with galaxies that show clear signs of interactions, at odds with the typical behavior observed in low-z FR I hosts. The compact radio morphology might imply that we are observing intrinsically small and possibly young objects that will eventually evolve into the giant FR Is we observe in the local universe. One of the objects appears as pointlike in Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images. This might belong to a population of FR I-QSOs, which however would represent a tiny minority of the overall population of high-z FR Is. As for the local FR Is, a large fraction of our objects are likely to be associated with groups or clusters, making them \"beacons\" for high-redshift clusters of galaxies. Our search for candidate high-z FR Is we present in this paper constitutes a pilot study for objects to be observed with future high-resolution and high-sensitivity instruments such as the EVLA and ALMA in the radio band, HST/WFC3 in the optical and IR, James Webb Space Telescope in the IR, as well as future generation X-ray satellites.", "Titre": "Low-Power Radio Galaxies in the Distant Universe: A Search for FR I at 1 < z < 2 in the Cosmos Field", "Type": "Journal article", "LienPDF": "/article/10.1088/0004-637X/696/2/1103/pdf", "doi": "10.1088/0004-637X/696/2/1103"}, {"Id": 77, "Autheur": "J.

However, no technique currently exists that yields NIR radial velocity precision comparable to that routinely obtained in the visible. We are carrying out an NIR radial velocity planet search program targeting a sample of the lowest-mass M dwarfs using the CRIRES instrument on the Very Large Telescope. In this first paper in a planned series about the project, we describe a method for measuring high-precision relative radial velocities of these stars from K-band spectra. The method makes use of a glass cell filled with ammonia gas to calibrate the spectrograph response similar to the \"iodine cell\" technique that has been used very successfully in the visible. Stellar spectra are obtained through the ammonia cell and modeled as the product of a Doppler-shifted template spectrum of the object and a spectrum of the cell, convolved with a variable instrumental profile (IP) model. A complicating factor is that a significant number of telluric absorption lines are present in the spectral regions containing useful stellar and ammonia lines. The telluric lines are modeled simultaneously as well using spectrum synthesis with a time-resolved model of the atmosphere over the observatory. The free parameters in the complete model are the wavelength scale of the spectrum, the IP, adjustments to the water and methane abundances in the atmospheric model, telluric spectrum Doppler shift, and stellar Doppler shift. Tests of the method based on the analysis of hundreds of spectra obtained for late-M dwarfs over 6 months demonstrate that precisions of ~ 5 m s–1 are obtainable over long timescales, and precisions of better than 3 m s–1 can be obtained over timescales up to a week. The obtained precision is comparable to the predicted photon-limited errors, but primarily limited over long timescales by the imperfect modeling of the telluric lines.", "Titre": "The CRIRES Search for Planets Around the Lowest-mass Stars.

In the case of GJ 436, the presence of a second planet is perhaps indicated by the residual orbital eccentricity of the known hot Neptune companion. We find no candidate transits with significance higher than our detection limit. From Monte Carlo tests of the time series, we rule out transiting planets larger than 1.5 R\n⊕ interior to GJ 436b with 95% confidence and larger than 1.25 R\n⊕ with 80% confidence. Assuming coplanarity of additional planets with the orbit of GJ 436b, we cannot expect that putative planets with orbital periods longer than about 3.4 days will transit. However, if such a planet were to transit, we would rule out planets larger than 2.0 R\n⊕ with orbital periods less than 8.5 days with 95% confidence. We also place dynamical constraints on additional bodies in the GJ 436 system, independent of radial velocity measurements. Our analysis should serve as a useful guide for similar analyses of transiting exoplanets for which radial velocity measurements are not available, such as those discovered by the Kepler mission.

We have developed a novel locally calibrated pixel (LCP) search method that uses adjacent regions of the spectrum to calibrate interlopers and spectral artifacts, which would otherwise limit the measurement of O VI absorption. Despite the challenges presented by searching for weak O VI within the Lyα forest in spectra of moderate resolution and signal-to-noise, we find a highly significant detection of absorption by oxygen at 2.7 < z < 3.2 (the null hypothesis has a χ2 = 80 for nine data points). We interpret our results using synthetic spectra generated from a log-normal density field assuming a mixed quasar-galaxy photoionizing background and that it dominates the ionization fraction of detected O VI.

The density-dependent enrichment model by Aguirre et al. is also an acceptable fit. All our successful models have similar mass-weighted oxygen abundance, corresponding to [O/HMW] = –2.45 ± 0.06.

This is, in part, because it is known that the super-diffusive properties of Lévy walks can be advantageous in random search scenarios when searchers have little or no prior knowledge of target locations. However, fractional Brownian motions (fBms) and fractional Lévy motions (fLms) are both scale-free and super-diffusive, and so it is possible that these motions rather than Lévy walks underlie some or all occurrences of scale-free animal movement patterns. Here this possibility is examined in numerical simulations through a determination of the searching efficiencies of fBm and fLm searches. It is shown that these searches are less efficient than Lévy walk searches. This finding does not rule out the possibility that some animals with scale-free movement patterns are executing fBm and fLm searches, but it does make Lévy walk searches the more likely possibility.", "Titre": "Scale-free animal movement patterns: Lévy walks outperform fractional Brownian motions and fractional Lévy motions in random search scenarios", "Type": "Journal article", "LienPDF": "/article/10.1088/1751-8113/42/43/434006/pdf", "doi": "10.1088/1751-8113/42/43/434006"}, {"Id": 110, "Autheur": "Gleb Oshanin, Katja Lindenberg, Horacio S Wio and Sergei Burlatsky", "Annee": "2009", "Resume": "We study the kinetics for the search of an immobile target by randomly moving searchers that detect it only upon encounter. The searchers perform intermittent random walks on a one-dimensional lattice. Each searcher can step on a nearest neighbor site with probability α or go off lattice with probability 1 − α to move in a random direction until it lands back on the lattice at a fixed distance L away from the departure point. Considering α and L as optimization parameters, we seek to enhance the chances of successful detection by minimizing the probability PN that the target remains undetected up to the maximal search time N. We show that even in this simple model, a number of very efficient search strategies can lead to a decrease of PN by orders of magnitude upon appropriate choices of α and L. We demonstrate that, in general, such optimal intermittent strategies are much more efficient than Brownian searches and are as efficient as search algorithms based on random walks with heavy-tailed Cauchy jump-length distributions.

The localization process is composed mainly of two phases: finding the chemical plume and then tracking it to its source. Plume tracking has been the subject of considerable study whereas plume finding has received little attention. We address here the latter issue, where the searching agent must find the plume in a region often many times larger than the plume and devoid of the relevant chemical cues. The probability of detecting the plume not only depends on the movements of the searching agent but also on the fluid mechanical regime, shaping plume intermittency in space and time; this is a basic, general problem when exploring for ephemeral resources (e.g. moving and/or concealing targets). Here we present a bio-inspired search strategy named Lévy-taxis that, under certain conditions, located odor plumes significantly faster and with a better success rate than other search strategies such as Lévy walks (LW), correlated random walks (CRW) and systematic zig-zag. These results are based on computer simulations which contain, for the first time ever, digitalized real-world water flow and chemical plume instead of their theoretical model approximations. Combining elements of LW and CRW, Lévy-taxis is particularly efficient for searching in flow-dominated environments: it adaptively controls the stochastic search pattern using environmental information (i.e. flow) that is available throughout the course of the search and shows correlation with the source providing the cues. This strategy finds natural application in real-world search missions, both by humans and autonomous robots, since it accomodates the stochastic nature of chemical mixing in turbulent flows. In addition, it may prove useful in the field of behavioral ecology, explaining and predicting the movement patterns of various animals searching for food or mates.", "Titre": "Lévy-taxis: a novel search strategy for finding odor plumes in turbulent flow-dominated environments", "Type": "Journal article", "LienPDF": "/article/10.1088/1751-8113/42/43/434010/pdf", "doi": "10.1088/1751-8113/42/43/434010"}, {"Id": 112, "Autheur": "Leonid Mirny, Michael Slutsky, Zeba Wunderlich, Anahita Tafvizi, Jason Leith and Andrej Kosmrlj", "Annee": "2009", "Resume": "A number of vital biological processes rely on fast and precise recognition of a specific DNA sequence (site) by a protein. How can a protein find its site on a long DNA molecule among 106–109 decoy sites? Here, we present our recent studies of the protein–DNA search problem. Seminal biophysical works suggested that the protein–DNA search is facilitated by 1D diffusion of the protein along DNA (sliding). We present a simple framework to calculate the mean search time and focus on several new aspects of the process such as the roles of DNA sequence and protein conformational flexibility. We demonstrate that coupling of DNA recognition with conformational transition within the protein–DNA complex is essential for fast search. To approach the complexity of the in vivo environment, we examine how the search can proceed at realistic DNA concentrations and binding constants. We propose a new mechanism for local distance-dependent search that is likely essential in bacteria. Simulations of the search on tightly packed DNA and crowded DNA demonstrate that our theoretical framework can be extended to correctly predicts search time in such complicated environments.

This method employs an extended line index for the CH G band, which we demonstrate to have superior performance when compared to the narrower G-band index formerly employed to estimate G-band strengths for these spectra. Although CEMP stars have been found previously among candidate metal-poor stars selected from the HES, the selection on metallicity undersamples the population of intermediate-metallicity CEMP stars (–2.5 ≤ [Fe/H] ≤ –1.0); such stars are of importance for constraining the onset of the s-process in metal-deficient asymptotic giant branch stars (thought to be associated with the origin of carbon for roughly 80% of CEMP stars). The new candidates also include substantial numbers of warmer carbon-enhanced stars, which were missed in previous HES searches for carbon stars due to selection criteria that emphasized cooler stars. A first subsample, biased toward brighter stars (B< 15.5), has been extracted from the scanned HES plates. After visual inspection (to eliminate spectra compromised by plate defects, overlapping spectra, etc., and to carry out rough spectral classifications), a list of 669 previously unidentified candidate CEMP stars was compiled. Follow-up spectroscopy for a pilot sample of 132 candidates was obtained with the Goodman spectrograph on the SOAR 4.1 m telescope. Our results show that most of the observed stars lie in the targeted metallicity range, and possess prominent carbon absorption features at 4300 Å. The success rate for the identification of new CEMP stars is 43% (13 out of 30) for [Fe/H] < –2.0.

Our results set an upper limit on the optical depth of Trojans in the HD 209458 system that can be used to guide current and future searches of similar systems by upcoming missions. Using cross-correlation methods with artificial signals implanted in the data, we find that our detection limit corresponds to a relative Trojan transit depth of 1 ×10–4, equivalent to ~1 lunar mass of asteroids, assuming power-law Trojan size distributions similar to Jupiter's Trojans in our solar system. We confirm with dynamical interpretations that some asteroids could have migrated inward with the planet to its current orbit at 0.045 AU, and that the Yarkovsky effect is ineffective at eliminating objects of >1 m in size. However, using numerical models of collisional evolution we find that, due to high relative speeds in this confined Trojan environment, collisions destroy the vast majority of the asteroids in <10 Myr. Our modeling indicates that the best candidates to search for exoTrojan swarms in 1:1 mean resonance orbits with “hot Jupiters” are young systems (ages of about 1 Myr or less).

We have developed a new selection process to find these missing members based on the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) All-Sky Imaging Survey (AIS). For stars with spectral types K5 (R – J  1.5) and younger than ≈300 Myr, we show that near-UV (NUV) and far-UV (FUV) emission is greatly enhanced above the quiescent photosphere, analogous to the enhanced X-ray emission of young low-mass stars seen by ROSAT but detectable to much larger distances with GALEX. By combining GALEX data with optical (HST Guide Star Catalog) and near-IR (2MASS) photometry, we identified an initial sample of 34 young M dwarf candidates in a 1000 deg2 region around the ≈10 Myr TW Hydra Association (TWA). Low-resolution spectroscopy of 30 of these found 16 which had Hα in emission, which were then followed up at high resolution to search for spectroscopic evidence of youth and to measure their radial velocities. Four objects have low surface gravities, photometric distances and space motions consistent with TWA, but the non-detection of Li indicates that they may be too old to belong to this moving group. One object (M3.5, 93 ± 19 pc) appears to be the first known accreting low-mass member of the ≈15 Myr Lower Centaurus Crux OB association. Two objects exhibit all the characteristics of the known TWA members, and thus we designate them as TWA 31 (M4.2, 110 ± 11 pc) and TWA 32 (M6.3, 53 ± 5 pc). TWA 31 shows extremely broad (447 km s–1) Hα emission, making it the sixth member of TWA found to have ongoing accretion. TWA 32 is resolved into a 06 binary in Keck laser guide star adaptive optics imaging. Our search should be sensitive down to spectral types of at least M4-M5 in TWA and thus the small numbers of new member is puzzling.

Our baseline 27-vector has aperture D = 16 m, inner working angle IWA = 0.039'', mission time t = 0-5 yr, occurrence probability for Earth-like exoplanets η = 0.2, and typical values for the remaining 23 parameters. For the baseline case, a typical five-year design reference mission has an input catalog of ~4700 stars with nonzero completeness, ~1300 unique stars observed in ~2600 observations, of which ~1300 are revisits, and it produces N\n1 ~ 50 exoplanets after one year and N\n5 ~ 130 after five years. We explore offsets from the baseline for 10 parameters. We find that N depends strongly on IWA and only weakly on D. It also depends only weakly on zodiacal light for Z < 50 zodis, end-to-end efficiency for h > 0.2, and scattered starlight for ζ < 10–10.

To examine the probability that microlensing events can be recovered in these data, we test statistics used on uniformly sampled data to identify variables and transients.

We develop a selection method using this statistic and apply it to data from fields with >10 R-band observations, 1.1 × 109 light curves, uncovering three candidate microlensing events.

Remarkably, the present results are simply based on archival data and are thus largely improvable by means of specifically tailored observations.

We discuss the argument of Hart that spacefaring life in the Milky Way should be either galaxy-spanning or non-existent, and examine a portion of his argument that we call the \"monocultural fallacy.\" We discuss some rebuttals to Hart that invoke sustainability and predict long Galaxy colonization timescales. We find that the maximum Galaxy colonization timescale is actually much shorter than previous work has found (<109 yr), and that many \"sustainability\" counter-arguments to Hart's thesis suffer from the monocultural fallacy. We extend Hart's argument to alien energy supplies and argue that detectably large energy supplies can plausibly be expected to exist because life has the potential for exponential growth until checked by resources or other limitations, and intelligence implies the ability to overcome such limitations. As such, if Hart's thesis is correct, then searches for large alien civilizations in other galaxies may be fruitful; if it is incorrect, then searches for civilizations within the Milky Way are more likely to succeed than Hart argued. We review some past Dysonian SETI efforts and discuss the promise of new mid-infrared surveys, such as that of WISE.", "Titre": "The Ĝ Infrared Search for Extraterrestrial Civilizations with Large Energy Supplies.

We develop a formalism for translating mid-infrared photometry into quantitative upper limits on extraterrestrial energy supplies. We discuss the likely sources of false positives, how dust can and will contaminate our search, and prospects for distinguishing dust from alien waste heat. We argue that galaxy-spanning civilizations may be easier to distinguish from natural sources than circumstellar civilizations (i.e., Dyson spheres), although GAIA will significantly improve our capability to identify the latter. We present a zeroth order null result of our search based on the WISE all-sky catalog: we show, for the first time, that Kardashev Type III civilizations (as Kardashev originally defined them) are very rare in the local universe. More sophisticated searches can extend our methodology to smaller waste heat luminosities, and potentially entirely rule out (or detect) both Kardashev Type III civilizations and new physics that allows for unlimited \"free\" energy generation.", "Titre": "The Ĝ Infrared Search for Extraterrestrial Civilizations with Large Energy Supplies.

One way to distinguish between the single-degenerate scenario and double-degenerate scenario for their progenitors is to search for the surviving companions (SCs). Using a technique that couples the results from multi-dimensional hydrodynamics simulations with calculations of the structure and evolution of main-sequence- (MS-) and helium-rich SCs, the color and magnitude of MS- and helium-rich SCs are predicted as functions of time. The SC candidates in Galactic type Ia supernova remnants (Ia SNR) and nearby extragalactic Ia SNRs are discussed. We find that the maximum detectable distance of MS SCs (helium-rich SCs) is 0.6-4 Mpc (0.4-16 Mpc), if the apparent magnitude limit is 27 in the absence of extinction, suggesting that the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds and the Andromeda Galaxy are excellent environments in which to search for SCs. However, only five Ia SNRs have been searched for SCs, showing little support for the standard channels in the singe-degenerate scenario. To better understand the progenitors of SNe Ia, we encourage the search for SCs in other nearby Ia SNRs.", "Titre": "Search for Surviving Companions in Type Ia Supernova Remnants", "Type": "Journal article", "LienPDF": "/article/10.1088/0004-637X/792/1/71/pdf", "doi": "10.1088/0004-637X/792/1/71"}, {"Id": 138, "Autheur": "David Keitel", "Annee": "2016", "Resume": "Non-axisymmetries in rotating neutron stars emit quasi-monochromatic gravitational waves. These long-duration 'continuous wave' signals are among the main search targets of ground-based interferometric detectors. However, standard detection methods are susceptible to false alarms from instrumental artefacts that resemble a continuous-wave signal. Past work [Keitel, Prix, Papa, Leaci and Siddiqi 2014, Phys. Rev. D 89 064023] showed that a Bayesian approach, based on an explicit model of persistent single-detector disturbances, improves robustness against such artefacts. Since many strong outliers in semi-coherent searches of LIGO data are caused by transient disturbances that last only a few hours or days, I describe in a recent paper [Keitel D 2015, LIGO-P1500159] how to extend this approach to cover transient disturbances, and demonstrate increased sensitivity in realistic simulated data. Additionally, neutron stars could emit transient signals which, for a limited time, also follow the continuous-wave signal model. As a pragmatic alternative to specialized transient searches, I demonstrate how to make standard semi-coherent continuous-wave searches more sensitive to transient signals. Focusing on the time-scale of a single segment in the semi-coherent search, Bayesian model selection yields a simple detection statistic without a significant increase in computational cost.

Guide stars are primarily used by Pan-STARRS to compensate for image motion and hence improve the point-spread function. With suitable selection of the guide stars within the Pan-STARRS 7 deg2 field of view, the light curves of these guide stars can also be used to search for occultations by TNOs. The best target stars for this purpose are stars with high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) and small angular size. In order to do this, we compiled a catalog using the S/N calculated from stars with m\nV < 13 mag in the Tycho2 catalog, then cross matched these stars with the Two Micron All Sky Survey catalog, and estimated their angular sizes from (V – K) color. We also outlined a new detection method based on matched filter that is optimized to search for diffraction patterns in the light curves due to occultation by sub-kilometer TNOs. A detection threshold is set to compromise between real detections and false positives. Depending on the theoretical size distribution model used, we expect to find up to a hundred events during the three-year lifetime of the Pan-STARRS-1 project. The high sampling (30 Hz) of the project facilitates detections of small objects (as small as 400 m), which are numerous according to power-law size distribution, and thus allows us to verify various models and further constrain our understanding of the structure in the outer reach of the solar system. We have tested the detection algorithm and the pipeline on a set of engineering data (taken at 10 Hz instead of 30 Hz). No events were found within the engineering data, which is consistent with the small size of the data set and the theoretical models. Meanwhile, with a total of ~22 star-hours video mode data (|β| < 10°), we are able to set an upper limit of N(>0.5 km) ~ 2.47 × 1010 deg–2 at 95% confidence limit.", "Titre": "Searching for Sub-kilometer Trans-Neptunian Objects Using Pan-STARRS Video Mode Light Curves: Preliminary Study and Evaluation Using Engineering Data", "Type": "Journal article", "LienPDF": "/article/10.1088/0004-6256/139/5/2003/pdf", "doi": "10.1088/0004-6256/139/5/2003"}, {"Id": 143, "Autheur": "R.

This technique involves the indexing of the database models based on the sign of the projections (PCA coefficients) of the first few relevant orders of principal components of the four Stokes parameters. In this way, each model in the database can be attributed a distinctive binary number of 24n\n bits, where n is the number of PCA orders used for the indexing. Each of these binary numbers (indices) identifies a group of \"compatible\" models for the inversion of a given set of observed Stokes profiles sharing the same index. The complete set of the binary numbers so constructed evidently determines a partition of the database. The search of the database for the PCA inversion of spectro-polarimetric data can profit greatly from this indexing. In practical cases it becomes possible to approach the ideal acceleration factor of 24n\n as compared to the systematic search of a non-indexed database for a traditional PCA inversion. This indexing method relies on the existence of a physical meaning in the sign of the PCA coefficients of a model. For this reason, the presence of model ambiguities and of spectro-polarimetric noise in the observations limits in practice the number n of relevant PCA orders that can be used for the indexing.", "Titre": "Improved Search of Principal Component Analysis Databases for Spectro-polarimetric Inversion", "Type": "Journal article", "LienPDF": "/article/10.1088/0004-637X/773/2/180/pdf", "doi": "10.1088/0004-637X/773/2/180"}, {"Id": 144, "Autheur": "J.

For short-hard GRBs we place exclusion distances on binary neutron star and neutron-star-black-hole progenitors, using astrophysically motivated priors on the source parameters, with median values of 16 Mpc and 28 Mpc, respectively. These distance limits, while significantly larger than for a search that is not aided by GRB satellite observations, are not large enough to expect a coincidence with a GRB. However, projecting these exclusions to the sensitivities of Advanced LIGO and Virgo, which should begin operation in 2015, we find that the detection of gravitational waves associated with GRBs will become quite possible.", "Titre": "Search for Gravitational Waves Associated with Gamma-Ray Bursts during LIGO Science Run 6 and Virgo Science Runs 2 and 3", "Type": "Journal article", "LienPDF": "/article/10.1088/0004-637X/760/1/12/pdf", "doi": "10.1088/0004-637X/760/1/12"}, {"Id": 145, "Autheur": "S.

A total sky area of 2.66 deg2, spread over 141 fields at low Galactic latitudes (b6-8 deg), was observed 16 times with a cadence that was chosen to sample timescales of days, months, and years. Most of the data were reduced, analyzed, and searched for transients in near real-time. Interesting candidates were followed up using visible light telescopes (typical delays of 1-2 hr) and the X-ray Telescope on board the Swift satellite. The final processing of the data revealed a single possible transient with a peak flux density of f\nν2.4 mJy. This implies a transient's sky surface density of κ(f\nν > 1.8 mJy) = 0.039+0.13, +0.18\n– 0.032, –0.038 deg–2 (1σ, 2σ confidence errors). This areal density is roughly consistent with the sky surface density of transients from the Bower et al. survey extrapolated to 1.8 mJy. Our observed transient areal density is consistent with a neutron star's origin for these events. Furthermore, we use the data to measure the source variability on timescales of days to years, and we present the variability structure function of 5 GHz sources. The mean structure function shows a fast increase on ≈1 day timescale, followed by a slower increase on timescales of up to 10 days. On timescales between 10 and 60 days, the structure function is roughly constant. We find that  30% of the unresolved sources brighter than 1.8 mJy are variables at the >4σ confidence level, presumably mainly due to refractive scintillation.", "Titre": "A Very Large Array Search for 5 GHz Radio Transients and Variables at Low Galactic Latitudes", "Type": "Journal article", "LienPDF": "/article/10.1088/0004-637X/740/2/65/pdf", "doi": "10.1088/0004-637X/740/2/65"}, {"Id": 147, "Autheur": "Steven Lowette", "Annee": "2016", "Resume": "A review is given of the current status of searches for dark matter at accelerators.

For this search, ephemerides overlapping the run period were obtained for all pulsars using radio and X-ray observations. We demonstrate an updated search method that allows for small uncertainties in the pulsar phase parameters to be included in the search. We report no signal detection from any of the targets and therefore interpret our results as upper limits on the gravitational wave signal strength. The most interesting limits are those for young pulsars. We present updated limits on gravitational radiation from the Crab pulsar, where the measured limit is now a factor of 7 below the spin-down limit. This limits the power radiated via gravitational waves to be less than ~2% of the available spin-down power. For the X-ray pulsar J0537 – 6910 we reach the spin-down limit under the assumption that any gravitational wave signal from it stays phase locked to the X-ray pulses over timing glitches, and for pulsars J1913+1011 and J1952+3252 we are only a factor of a few above the spin-down limit. Of the recycled millisecond pulsars, several of the measured upper limits are only about an order of magnitude above their spin-down limits. For these our best (lowest) upper limit on gravitational wave amplitude is 2.3 × 10–26 for J1603 – 7202 and our best (lowest) limit on the inferred pulsar ellipticity is 7.0 × 10–8 for J2124 – 3358.", "Titre": "Searches for Gravitational Waves from Known Pulsars with Science Run 5 LIGO Data", "Type": "Journal article", "LienPDF": "/article/10.1088/0004-637X/713/1/671/pdf", "doi": "10.1088/0004-637X/713/1/671"}, {"Id": 149, "Autheur": "Fronefield Crawford, Jason W.

The corresponding radio luminosity limits are significantly below the observed luminosities of the majority of the observed radio pulsars, and they are significantly below the radio luminosity of XTE J1810-197, the only AXP known thus far to emit radio pulsations, at the epoch when radio pulses were first detected from this source. Our null results support the hypothesis that pulsed radio emission from AXPs is only present in conjunction with X-ray outburst activity. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that pulsed radio emission is present, but that it is too weak to be detected in our observations, or that unfavorable viewing geometries prevent this emission from being seen by terrestrial observers.

These images reach 5σ sensitivities of J\n110 = 26.0-27.5 (AB), and combined they increase the amount of deep near-infrared data by more than 60% in fields where the investment in deep optical data has already been made.

50–1000 Hz with the first derivative of frequency in the range −8.9 × 10−10 Hz s−1 to zero in two years of data collected during LIGO's fifth science run. Our results employ a Hough transform technique, introducing a χ2 test and analysis of coincidences between the signal levels in years 1 and 2 of observations that offers a significant improvement in the product of strain sensitivity with compute cycles per data sample compared to previously published searches. Since our search yields no surviving candidates, we present results taking the form of frequency dependent, 95% confidence upper limits on the strain amplitude h0. The most stringent upper limit from year 1 is 1.0 × 10−24 in the 158.00–158.25 Hz band. In year 2, the most stringent upper limit is 8.9 × 10−25 in the 146.50–146.75 Hz band. This improved detection pipeline, which is computationally efficient by at least two orders of magnitude better than our flagship Einstein@Home search, will be important for 'quick-look' searches in the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detector era.", "Titre": "Application of a Hough search for continuous gravitational waves on data from the fifth LIGO science run", "Type": "Journal article", "LienPDF": "/article/10.1088/0264-9381/31/8/085014/pdf", "doi": "10.1088/0264-9381/31/8/085014"}, {"Id": 153, "Autheur": "G.

A total of 15,366 GRPs were recorded during 11.6 hr of simultaneous observations, which were made across four nights in 2008 December and in 2009 November and December. We searched for an enhancement of the pulsed gamma-ray emission within time windows placed around the arrival time of the GRP events. In total, eight different time windows with durations ranging from 0.033 ms to 72 s were positioned at three different locations relative to the GRP to search for enhanced gamma-ray emission which lagged, led, or was concurrent with, the GRP event. Furthermore, we performed separate searches on main pulse GRPs and interpulse GRPs and on the most energetic GRPs in our data sample. No significant enhancement of pulsed VHE emission was found in any of the preformed searches. We set upper limits of 5-10 times the average VHE flux of the Crab pulsar on the flux simultaneous with interpulse GRPs on single-rotation-period timescales. On ~8 s timescales around interpulse GRPs, we set an upper limit of 2-3 times the average VHE flux. Within the framework of recent models for pulsed VHE emission from the Crab pulsar, the expected VHE-GRP emission correlations are below the derived limits.", "Titre": "Search for a Correlation between Very-high-energy Gamma Rays and Giant Radio Pulses in the Crab Pulsar", "Type": "Journal article", "LienPDF": "/article/10.1088/0004-637X/760/2/136/pdf", "doi": "10.1088/0004-637X/760/2/136"}, {"Id": 156, "Autheur": "The Pierre Auger Collaboration1, P.

In total, we find eight  ~ 7.3 z-dropouts in our search fields, but no z ~ 9 J-dropout candidates. A careful consideration of a wide variety of different contaminants suggest an overall contamination level of just ~12% for our z-dropout selection. After performing detailed simulations to accurately estimate the selection volumes, we derive constraints on the UV LFs at z ~ 7 and z ~ 9. For a faint-end slope α  =  − 1.74, our most likely values for MUV* and * at z ~ 7 are –19.8 ± 0.4 mag and 1.1+ 1.7−0.7 × 10−3 Mpc−3, respectively. Our search results for z ~ 9 J-dropouts set a 1 σ lower limit on MUV* of –19.6 mag assuming that * and α are the same as their values at slightly later times. This lower limit on MUV* is 1.4 mag fainter than our best-fit value at z ~ 4, suggesting that the UV LF has undergone substantial evolution over this time period. No evolution is ruled out at 99% confidence from z ~ 7 to z ~ 6 and at 80% confidence from z ~ 9 to z ~ 7.

However, studies attempting to confirm this possibility have been inconclusive. To refine the search for these objects, Baumgardt et al. completed a series of N-body simulations to determine the observational properties that a host globular cluster should possess. Keys to revealing the presence of an IMBH were found to be the shape of the cluster's core proper motion dispersion profile and its surface density profile. Among the possible host clusters identified by Baumgardt et al., NGC 6266 was found to be the most suitable object to search. Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 images with an epoch difference of eight years were, therefore, used to measure this cluster's internal proper motion dispersion profile from 0.8 arcsec to 17 arcsec from the cluster center. This profile and the surface density profiles obtained by Noyola & Gebhardt and Trager et al. were then compared to those produced by N-body simulations of NGC 6266 with and without an IMBH. We find that a centrally located IMBH is not required to match these profiles, but that an IMBH with a 1σ upper limit mass of less than a few thousand M\n☉ cannot be excluded.

Given the increasing availability of high-resolution observation data, statistical inference for search paths based on such high-resolution data has recently become one of the major interests and has raised an important issue of robustness of random walk models to the sampling rate, as estimation results for the discrete observation data are found to be largely different at different sampling rates even when the underlying movement is supposedly independent of scale. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose to model the continuous-time search paths directly with a continuous-time stochastic process for which the observer makes statistical inference based on its discrete observation. As continuous-time counterparts of Lévy flights, we consider two-dimensional Lévy processes and discuss the relevance of those models based upon advantages and limitations in terms of statistical properties and inference. Among the proposed models, the Brownian motion is most tractable in various ways while its Gaussianity and infinite variation of sample paths do not well describe the reality.

The recent localization of the source of the X-ray emission has made a targeted search for radio pulsations from this source possible. The detection of pulsed radio emission from XTE J0103–728 would make it only the second system after PSR B1259–63 that is both a Be/X-ray binary and a radio pulsar. We observed XTE J0103–728 in 2008 February with the Parkes 64 m radio telescope soon after the identification of the source of X-ray pulsations was reported in order to search for corresponding radio pulsations. We used a continuous 6.4 hr observation with a 256 MHz bandwidth centered at 1390 MHz using the center beam of the Parkes multibeam receiver. In the subsequent data analysis, which included a folding search, a Fourier search, a fast-folding algorithm search, and a single pulse search, no pulsed signals were found for trial dispersion measures (DMs) between 0 and 800 pc cm–3. This DM range easily encompasses the expected values for sources in the SMC. We place an upper limit of ~45 mJy kpc2 on the luminosity of periodic radio emission from XTE J0103–728 at the epoch of our observation, and we compare this limit to a range of luminosities measured for PSR B1259–63, the only Be/X-ray binary currently known to emit radio pulses. We also compare our limit to the radio luminosities of neutron stars having similarly long spin periods to XTE J0103–728. Since the radio pulses from PSR B1259–63 are eclipsed and undetectable during the portion of the orbit near periastron, repeated additional radio search observations of XTE J0103–728 may be valuable if it is undergoing similar eclipsing and if such observations are able to sample the orbital phase of this system well.", "Titre": "Upper Limits on Pulsed Radio Emission from the 6.85 s X-Ray Pulsar XTE J0103–728 in the Small Magellanic Cloud", "Type": "Journal article", "LienPDF": "/article/10.1088/0004-637X/696/1/574/pdf", "doi": "10.1088/0004-637X/696/1/574"}, {"Id": 171, "Autheur": "Nicholas M.

Unlike most known eclipsing systems of this type, the optical and infrared emission is dominated by the M-dwarf components, and the systems have optical colors and discovery light curves consistent with being Jupiter-radius transiting planets around early M-dwarfs. We detail the PTF/M-dwarf transiting planet survey, part of the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF). We present a graphics processing unit (GPU)-based box-least-squares search for transits that runs approximately 8 × faster than similar algorithms implemented on general purpose systems. For the discovered systems, we decompose low-resolution spectra of the systems into white-dwarf and M-dwarf components, and use radial velocity measurements and cooling models to estimate masses and radii for the white dwarfs. The systems are compact, with periods between 0.35 and 0.45 days and semimajor axes of approximately 2 R\n☉ (0.01 AU). The M-dwarfs have masses of approximately 0.35 M\n☉, and the white dwarfs have hydrogen-rich atmospheres with temperatures of around 8000 K and have masses of approximately 0.5 M\n☉. We use the Robo-AO laser guide star adaptive optics system to tentatively identify one of the objects as a triple system. We also use high-cadence photometry to put an upper limit on the white-dwarf radius of 0.025 R\n☉ (95% confidence) in one of the systems. Accounting for our detection efficiency and geometric factors, we estimate that  (90% confidence) of M-dwarfs are in these short-period, post-common-envelope white-dwarf/M-dwarf binaries where the optical light is dominated by the M-dwarf. The lack of detections at shorter periods, despite near-100% detection efficiency for such systems, suggests that binaries including these relatively low-temperature white dwarfs are preferentially found at relatively large orbital radii. Similar eclipsing binary systems can have arbitrarily small eclipse depths in red bands and generate plausible small-planet-transit light curves. As such, these systems are a source of false positives for M-dwarf transiting planet searches.

However, with only three giant flares ever recorded, and only two with data of sufficient quality to search for QPOs, such analysis is seriously data limited. We set out a procedure for doing QPO searches in the far more numerous, short, less energetic magnetar bursts. The short, transient nature of these bursts requires the implementation of sophisticated statistical techniques to make reliable inferences. Using Bayesian statistics, we model the periodogram as a combination of red noise at low frequencies and white noise at high frequencies, which we show is a conservative approach to the problem. We use empirical models to make inferences about the potential signature of periodic and QPOs at these frequencies. We compare our method with previously used techniques and find that although it is on the whole more conservative, it is also more reliable in ruling out false positives. We illustrate our Bayesian method by applying it to a sample of 27 bursts from the magnetar SGR J0501+4516 observed by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor, and we find no evidence for the presence of QPOs in any of the bursts in the unbinned spectra, but do find a candidate detection in the binned spectra of one burst.

This is followed by a fast second stage in which areas in frequency space are identified as signal candidates through the frequency domain convolution of the -statistic with an approximate signal template. For this second stage only precise information on the orbit period and approximate information on the orbital semi-major axis are required a priori. For the final stage we propose a fully coherent Markov chain Monte Carlo based follow-up search on the frequency subspace defined by the candidates identified by the second stage.

No convincing candidate was detected in the survey, with a 10σ detection threshold of ~10 μJy achieved in two separate observing sessions. This survey represents a significant improvement over previous searches for pulsars at the GC and would have detected a significant fraction (5%) of the pulsars around Sgr A*, if they had properties similar to those of the known population.

The star was observed in two epochs 39 days apart, with different focal plane rotation to allow the subtraction of the instrumental point-spread function, achieving a maximum sensitivity of 0.01 MJy sr-1 at 3.6 and 4.5 μm, and 0.05 MJy sr-1 at 5.8 and 8.0 μm. This sensitivity is not sufficient to directly detect scattered or thermal radiation from the  Eri debris disk. It is, however, sufficient to allow the detection of Jovian planets with mass as low as 1MJ in the IRAC 4.5 μm band. In this band, we detected over 460 sources within the 570 field of view of our images. To test if any of these sources could be a low-mass companion to  Eri, we have compared their colors and magnitudes with models and photometry of low-mass objects. Of the sources detected in at least two IRAC bands, none fall into the range of mid-IR color and luminosity expected for cool, 1 Gyr substellar and planetary mass companions of  Eri, as determined by both models and observations of field M, L, and T dwarfs. We identify three new sources that have detections at 4.5 μm only, the lower limit placed on their [3.6]-[4.5] color consistent with models of planetary mass objects.

The targets were nine young supernova remnants not associated with pulsars; eight of the remnants are associated with non-pulsing suspected neutron stars. One target's parameters are uncertain enough to warrant two searches, for a total of 10. Each search covered a broad band of frequencies and first and second frequency derivatives for a fixed sky direction. The searches coherently integrated data from the two LIGO interferometers over time spans from 5.3–25.3 days using the matched-filtering -statistic. We found no evidence of GW signals. We set 95% confidence upper limits as strong (low) as 4 × 10−25 on intrinsic strain, 2 × 10−7 on fiducial ellipticity, and 4 × 10−5 on r-mode amplitude. These beat the indirect limits from energy conservation and are within the range of theoretical predictions for neutron-star ellipticities and r-mode amplitudes.", "Titre": "Searches for Continuous Gravitational Waves from Nine Young Supernova Remnants", "Type": "Journal article", "LienPDF": "/article/10.1088/0004-637X/813/1/39/pdf", "doi": "10.1088/0004-637X/813/1/39"}, {"Id": 198, "Autheur": "Jean-Michel Désert, Alain Lecavelier des Etangs, Guillaume Hébrard, David K.

Atmospheric models for these planets predict that the strongest spectrophotometric features of those molecules are located at wavelengths ranging from 1 to 10 μm  making this region of particular interest. Consequently, transit observations in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) allow the atmospheric content of transiting planets to be determined. We present new primary transit observations of the hot-Jupiter HD 189733b, obtained simultaneously at 4.5 and 8 μm with the Infrared Array Camera onboard the Spitzer\nSpace Telescope. Together with a new refined analysis of previous observations at 3.6 and 5.8 μm using the same instrument, we are able to derive the system parameters, including planet-to-star radius ratio, impact parameter, scale of the system, and central time of the transit from fits of the transit light curves at these four wavelengths. We measure the four planet-to-star radius ratios, to be (Rp\n/R\n)3.6 μm = 0.1545 ± 0.0003, (Rp\n/R\n)4.5 μm = 0.1557 ± 0.0003, (Rp\n/R\n)5.8 μm = 0.1547 ± 0.0005, and (Rp\n/R\n)8 μm = 0.1544 ± 0.0004. The high accuracy of the planet radii measurement allows the search for atmospheric molecular absorbers. Contrary to a previous analysis of the same data set, our study is robust against systematics and reveals that water vapor absorption at 5.8 μm is not detected in this photometric data set. Furthermore, in the band centered around 4.5 μm we find a hint of excess absorption with an apparent planetary radius ΔRp\n/R\n* =  0.00128 ± 0.00056 larger (2.3σ) than the one measured simultaneously at 8 μm. This value is 4σ above what would be expected for an atmosphere where water vapor is the only absorbing species in the near-IR. This shows that an additional species absorbing around 4.5 μm could be present in the atmosphere. Carbon monoxide (CO) being a strong absorber at this wavelength is a possible candidate and this may suggest a large CO/H2O ratio between 5 and 60.", "Titre": "Search for Carbon Monoxide in the Atmosphere of the Transiting Exoplanet HD 189733b", "Type": "Journal article", "LienPDF": "/article/10.1088/0004-637X/699/1/478/pdf", "doi": "10.1088/0004-637X/699/1/478"}, {"Id": 199, "Autheur": "Renu John, Joby Joseph and Kehar Singh", "Annee": "2005", "Resume": "We demonstrate content-addressable holographic data storage with security using random\nphase encoding in the Fresnel domain.

However, LMWDs are believed to evolve in binary systems and to have either a more massive white dwarf (WD) or a neutron star (NS) as a companion. Indeed, evolutionary models of low-mass X-ray binaries, the precursors of millisecond pulsars (MSPs), produce significant numbers of LMWDs, suggesting that the SDSS LMWDs may have NS companions. No convincing pulsar signal is detected in our data. This is consistent with the findings of van Leeuwen et al., who conducted a GBT search for radio pulsations at 340 MHz from unseen companions to eight SDSS WDs (five are still considered LMWDs; the three others are now classified as \"ordinary\" WDs).

These features may provide better tracking and energy resolution for double-beta decay searches. They are also expected to enhance columnar recombination for nuclear recoils, which can be used for searches for WIMP dark matter with directional sensitivity. We constructed a test ionization chamber and successfully measured scintillation and ionization yields at high precision with various Xe and TMA mixtures and pressures.

This binary's short period implies that any coherent signal would be highly accelerated, so we used phase modulation searches, orbital-parameter-fitting coherent searches, and standard acceleration searches to give significant sensitivity to millisecond pulsations. At a range of luminosities and in four energy bands, we searched a total of 34 archival RXTE observations, 32 of which had on-source integration times longer than 10 ks and some of which were made consecutively, which allowed us to combine them. We found no pulsations. Using our phase modulation search technique, which we ran on all 34 observations, we have been able to place the first stringent (95% confidence) pulsed fraction limits of 0.8% on all realistic spin frequencies (i.e., 2 kHz) and likely companion masses (0.02 M☉ ≤ Mc ≤ 0.3 M☉).

A new search method is used, \"stacking\" the GW data around the times of individual soft-gamma bursts in the storm to enhance sensitivity for models in which multiple bursts are accompanied by GW emission. We assume that variation in the time difference between burst electromagnetic emission and potential burst GW emission is small relative to the GW signal duration, and we time-align GW excess power time-frequency tilings containing individual burst triggers to their corresponding electromagnetic emissions. We use two GW emission models in our search: a fluence-weighted model and a flat (unweighted) model for the most electromagnetically energetic bursts. We find no evidence of GWs associated with either model. Model-dependent GW strain, isotropic GW emission energy E\nGW, and γ ≡ E\nGW/E\nEM upper limits are estimated using a variety of assumed waveforms. The stacking method allows us to set the most stringent model-dependent limits on transient GW strain published to date. We find E\nGW upper limit estimates (at a nominal distance of 10 kpc) of between 2 × 1045 erg and 6 × 1050 erg depending on the waveform type. These limits are an order of magnitude lower than upper limits published previously for this storm and overlap with the range of electromagnetic energies emitted in soft gamma repeater (SGR) giant flares.", "Titre": "Stacked Search for Gravitational Waves from the 2006 SGR 1900+14 Storm", "Type": "Journal article", "LienPDF": "/article/10.1088/0004-637X/701/2/L68/pdf", "doi": "10.1088/0004-637X/701/2/L68"}, {"Id": 222, "Autheur": "M.

IceTop can detect an astrophysical flux of neutrons from Galactic sources as an excess of cosmic-ray air showers arriving from the source direction. Neutrons are undeflected by the Galactic magnetic field and can typically travel 10 (E/PeV) pc before decay. Two searches are performed using 4 yr of the IceTop data set to look for a statistically significant excess of events with energies above 10 PeV (1016 eV) arriving within a small solid angle. The all-sky search method covers from −90° to approximately −50° in declination. No significant excess is found. A targeted search is also performed, looking for significant correlation with candidate sources in different target sets. This search uses a higher-energy cut (100 PeV) since most target objects lie beyond 1 kpc. The target sets include pulsars with confirmed TeV energy photon fluxes and high-mass X-ray binaries. No significant correlation is found for any target set.

We explore false-alarm scenarios inspired by various curiosities in the data. Ultimately, a line profile and bisector analysis lead us to conclude that the ~100 m s–1 residuals are an artifact of spectral contamination from a stellar companion contributing ~15%-30% of the optical light in the system.

We map a total of 40.5 deg2 around the Draco, Ursa Major II, Coma Berenices, and Willman 1 dSphs with the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) at 1.4 GHz to detect this annihilation signature, greatly reducing discrete-source confusion using the NVSS catalog.

For Draco we obtained approximately concurrent Very Large Array observations to quantify the variability of the discrete source background, and find it to have a negligible effect on our results. We construct radial surface brightness profiles from each of the subtracted maps, and jackknife the data to quantify the significance of the features therein.

Using Google Insights for Search, clear peaks in volume occur at times of planting and harvest at the national level, which were used to derive corn specific planting and harvesting dates at a weekly resolution. Disaggregated to state level, search volumes for corn planting generally are in agreement with planting dates from a global crop calendar dataset. However, harvest dates were less discriminatory at the state level, indicating that peaks in search volume may be blurred by broader searches on harvest as a time of cultural events. The timing of other agricultural activities such as purchase of seed and response to weed and pest infestation was also investigated. These results highlight the future potential of using Web search data to derive planting dates in countries where the data are sparse or unreliable, once sufficient search volumes are realized, as well as the potential for monitoring in real time the response of farmers to climate change over the coming decades.

We search for potentially coherent signals in the neutron star rest frame by first removing the phase delays associated with the star's binary motion and computing fast Fourier transform power spectra of continuous light curves with up to 230 time bins. We search a range of frequencies in which both r- and g-modes are theoretically expected to reside. Using data from the discovery outburst of the 435 Hz pulsar XTE J1751–305 we find a single candidate, coherent oscillation with a frequency of 0.5727597 × νspin = 249.332609 Hz, and a fractional Fourier amplitude of 7.46 × 10–4. We estimate the significance of this feature at the 1.6 × 10–3 level, slightly better than a 3σ detection. Based on the observed frequency we argue that possible mode identifications include rotationally modified g-modes associated with either a helium-rich surface layer or a density discontinuity due to electron captures on hydrogen in the accreted ocean. In the latter case the presence of sufficient hydrogen in this ultracompact system with a likely helium-rich donor would present an interesting puzzle. Alternatively, the frequency could be identified with that of an inertial mode or a core r-mode modified by the presence of a solid crust; however, the r-mode amplitude required to account for the observed modulation amplitude would induce a large spin-down rate inconsistent with the observed pulse timing measurements. For the AMXPs XTE J1814–338 and NGC 6440 X–2 we do not find any candidate oscillation signals, and we place upper limits on the fractional Fourier amplitude of any coherent oscillations in our frequency search range of 7.8 × 10–4 and 5.6 × 10–3, respectively.

Since IceCube track-like events have much better angular resolution, we here search for possible short-term gamma-ray flares that are associated with the IceCube track-like events with Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) observations. Among them, three track-like neutrino events occur within the field of view of Fermi-LAT at the time of the detection, so searching for the prompt gamma-ray emission associated with neutrinos is possible. Assuming a point source origin and a single power-law spectrum for the possible gamma-ray sources associated with neutrinos, a likelihood analysis of 0.2–100 GeV photons observed by Fermi-LAT on the timescales of ~12 hr and one year are performed, and for the three special neutrinos, the analyses are also performed on the timescales of thousands of seconds before and after the neutrino detection. No significant GeV excesses over the background are found and upper limit fluxes at the 95% confidence level are obtained for different timescales.

We identified two high proper motion objects with the very red (W1 – W2) colors characteristic of T dwarfs, one being the known T7.5 dwarf GJ 570D. Near-IR spectroscopy of the other object (PSO J043.5395+02.3995 ≡ WISEP J025409.45+022359.1) reveals a spectral type of T8, leading to a photometric distance of 7.2 ± 0.7 pc. The 256 year–1 proper motion of PSO J043.5+02 is the second highest among field T dwarfs, corresponding to a tangential velocity of 87 ± 8 km s–1. According to the Besançon galaxy model, this velocity indicates that its galactic membership is probably in the thin disk, with the thick disk an unlikely possibility. Such membership is in accord with the near-IR spectrum, which points to a surface gravity (age) and metallicity typical of the field population. We combine 2MASS, Sloan Digital Sky Survey, WISE, and PS1 astrometry to derive a preliminary parallax of 171 ± 45 mas (5.8+2.0\n– 1.2 pc), the first such measurement using PS1 data. The proximity and brightness of PSO J043.5+02 will facilitate future characterization of its atmosphere, variability, multiplicity, distance, and kinematics.

An unbinned maximum likelihood ratio test was used to search for an excess of neutrinos above the atmospheric background at any given direction in the sky. By adding two more years of data with improved event selection and reconstruction techniques, the sensitivity was improved by a factor of 3.5 or more with respect to the previously published results obtained with the 40-string configuration of IceCube. We performed an all-sky survey and a dedicated search using a catalog of a priori selected objects observed by other telescopes. In both searches, the data are compatible with the background-only hypothesis. In the absence of evidence for a signal, we set upper limits on the flux of muon neutrinos. For an E\n–2 neutrino spectrum, the observed limits are (0.9-5) × 10–12 TeV–1 cm–2 s–1 for energies between 1 TeV and 1 PeV in the northern sky and (0.9-23.2) × 10–12 TeV–1 cm–2 s–1 for energies between 102 TeV and 102 PeV in the southern sky.

We have acquired MOST space-based photometry during 2007 and 2009, with the aims of measuring the stellar variability and searching for transits of GJ 581e, respectively. We quantify our sensitivity to shallow transit signals using Monte Carlo simulations, and perform a transit search within the 3σ transit windows corresponding to both the circular and Keplerian orbit ephemerides. Our analysis rules out transits for a planet with an orbital period of 3.15 days (GJ 581e) having a radius larger than 1.62 R\n⊕ (or a density lower than 2.39 g cm–3 for an orbital inclination of 90°) to 2σ confidence. Thus, if the planet transits, we can exclude hydrogen, helium, and water theoretical model compositions. The MOST photometry also allows us to rule out transits of GJ 581b within the Keplerian orbit-derived transit window for impact parameter values smaller than ~0.4 and confirm previous results which exclude transits for this planet within the circular orbit-derived transit window, for all plausible interior compositions. We find that the stellar brightness of GJ 581 is stable to within 1%, a characteristic which is favorable to the development of life in the habitable zone of the system. In the 2009 photometry, we detect a stellar signal with a period of 5.586 ± 0.051 days, which is close to the orbital period of GJ 581b (P = 5.37 days).

This review concisely discusses the experimental constraints set by the CDF and DØ collaborations with the complete dataset taken up to September 2011. Model-independent and model-dependent limits on Higgs boson masses and couplings have been set and interpretations are discussed both in the context of the Standard Model and in extended models. In spring 2012 the Tevatron extended the excluded SM Higgs boson mass range to 147 < mH < 179 GeV at 95% CL in the high-mass region beyond the LEP limit. The summer 2012 results for the same dataset pushed the expected limit from 141 GeV down to 139 GeV, while the observed limits remained unchanged. In the low-mass region an excess of data events with respect to the background estimation is observed in the mass range 120 < mH < 135 GeV which causes the limits to be not as stringent as expected. The significance for such an excess anywhere in the full mass range is approximately 2.5σ. Focusing on the associated production of a Higgs boson with a W or Z boson and the subsequent decay of the Higgs boson to a bottom–antibottom quark pair, evidence for the presence of a new particle, consistent with the SM Higgs boson has been established, with the largest local significance of 3.3σ, corresponding to a global significance of 3.1σ. The Tevatron observation in the given mass range is consistent with the discovery of a new particle of about 125 GeV mass at the LHC.

The results validate a multistage strategy, where the first stage scans the entire parameter space using an efficient semicoherent method and promising candidates are then refined through a fully coherent analysis.

This search assumes no prior information on the sky position of the source or the time of occurrence of its transient signals and, hence, is termed 'blind'. The pipeline computes the coherent network search statistic that is optimal in stationary, Gaussian noise. More importantly, it allows for the computation of a suite of alternative multi-detector coherent search statistics and signal-based discriminators that can improve the performance of CBC searches in real data, which can be both non-stationary and non-Gaussian. Also, unlike the coincident multi-detector search statistics that have been employed so far, the coherent statistics are different in the sense that they check for the consistency of the signal amplitudes and phases in the different detectors with their different orientations and with the signal arrival times in them. Since the computation of coherent statistics entails searching in the sky, it is more expensive than that of the coincident statistics that do not require it. To reduce computational costs, the first stage of the hierarchical pipeline constructs coincidences of triggers from the multiple interferometers, by requiring their proximity in time and component masses. The second stage follows up on these coincident triggers by computing the coherent statistics. Here, we compare the performances of this hierarchical pipeline with and without the second (or coherent) stage in Gaussian noise. Although introducing hierarchy can be expected to cause some degradation in the detection efficiency compared to that of a single-stage coherent pipeline, nevertheless it improves the computational speed of the search considerably. The two main results of this work are as follows: (1) the performance of the hierarchical coherent pipeline on Gaussian data is shown to be better than the pipeline with just the coincident stage; (2) the three-site network of LIGO detectors, in Hanford and Livingston (USA), and Virgo detector in Cascina (Italy) cannot resolve the polarization of waves arriving from certain parts of the sky. This can cause the three-site coherent statistic at those sky positions to become singular. Regularized versions of the statistic can avoid that problem, but can be expected to be sub-optimal. The aforementioned improvement in the pipeline's performance due to the coherent stage is in spite of this handicap.", "Titre": "A blind hierarchical coherent search for gravitational-wave signals from coalescing compact binaries in a network of interferometric detectors", "Type": "Journal article", "LienPDF": "/article/10.1088/0264-9381/28/13/134009/pdf", "doi": "10.1088/0264-9381/28/13/134009"}, {"Id": 259, "Autheur": "IceCube Collaboration, R.

The Galactic region considered in this work includes the local arm toward the Cygnus region and our closest approach to the Perseus Arm. The searches are based on the data collected between 2007 and 2009. During this time AMANDA was an integrated part of IceCube, which was still under construction and operated with 22 strings (2007-2008) and 40 strings (2008-2009) of optical modules deployed in the ice. By combining the advantages of the larger IceCube detector with the lower energy threshold of the more compact AMANDA detector, we obtain an improved sensitivity at energies below ~10 TeV with respect to previous searches. The analyses presented here are a scan for point sources within the Galactic plane, a search optimized for multiple and extended sources in the Cygnus region, which might be below the sensitivity of the point source scan, and studies of seven pre-selected neutrino source candidates. For one of them, Cygnus X-3, a time-dependent search for neutrino emission in coincidence with observed radio and X-ray flares has been performed. No evidence of a signal is found, and upper limits are reported for each of the searches. We investigate neutrino spectra proportional to E\n–2 and E\n–3 in order to cover the entire range of possible neutrino spectra. The steeply falling E\n–3 neutrino spectrum can also be used to approximate neutrino energy spectra with energy cutoffs below 50 TeV since these result in a similar energy distribution of events in the detector. For the region of the Galactic plane visible in the Northern sky, the 90% confidence level muon neutrino flux upper limits are in the range E\n3\ndN/dE ~ 5.4-19.5 × 10–11 TeV2 cm–2 s–1 for point-like neutrino sources in the energy region [180.0 GeV-20.5 TeV].

In this study, we have used this algorithm to investigate the relationship between plan quality and the extent of the beam direction search space, i.e. the set of candidate beam directions that may be selected for generating an optimal plan. For a group of ten prostate cancer patients, optimal IMRT plans were made for stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), mimicking high dose rate brachytherapy dosimetry. Plans were generated for five different beam direction input sets: a coplanar (CP) set and four non-coplanar (NCP) sets. For CP treatments, the search space consisted of 72 orientations (5° separations). The NCP CyberKnife (CK) space contained all directions available in the robotic CK treatment unit. The fully non-coplanar (F-NCP) set facilitated the highest possible degree of freedom in selecting optimal directions. CK+ and CK++ were subsets of F-NCP to investigate some aspects of the CK space. For each input set, plans were generated with up to 30 selected beam directions. Generated plans were clinically acceptable, according to an assessment of our clinicians. Convergence in plan quality occurred only after around 20 included beams. For individual patients, variations in PTV dose delivery between the five generated plans were minimal, as aimed for (average spread in V95: 0.4%). This allowed plan comparisons based on organ at risk (OAR) doses, with the rectum considered most important. Plans generated with the NCP search spaces had improved OAR sparing compared to the CP search space, especially for the rectum. OAR sparing was best with the F-NCP, with reductions in rectum DMean, V40Gy, V60Gy and D2% compared to CP of 25%, 35%, 37% and 8%, respectively. Reduced rectum sparing with the CK search space compared to F-NCP could be largely compensated by expanding CK with beams with relatively large direction components along the superior–inferior axis (CK++). Addition of posterior beams (CK++ → F-NCP) did not lead to further improvements in OAR sparing. Plans with 25 beams clearly performed better than 11-beam plans.

Our six targeted blazars are subjects of long-term monitoring campaigns by the VERITAS TeV γ-ray observatory. We use the publicly available VERITAS light curves to identify periods of excess and flaring emission. These predefined intervals serve as our \"active temporal windows\" in a search for an excess of neutrinos, relative to Poisson fluctuations of the near-isotropic atmospheric neutrino background, which dominates at these energies. After defining the parameters of an optimized search, we confirm the expected Poisson behavior with Monte Carlo simulations prior to testing for excess neutrinos in the actual data. We make two searches: one for excess neutrinos associated with the bright flares of Mrk 421 that occurred during the IC40 run, and one for excess neutrinos associated with the brightest emission periods of five other blazars (Mrk 501, 1ES 0806+524, 1ES 1218+304, 3C 66A, and W Comae), all significantly fainter than the Mrk 421 flares.

To overcome this difficulty we carry out systematic first-principles calculations aimed at finding potential new multicomponent TM aluminum nitride alloys for advanced hard coating applications. We direct our search towards a specific property, the thermal stability of the coating.

We consider here the resident SNRs in the nearby Sculptor group Sd galaxy NGC 7793. Using our own Very Large Array (VLA) radio observations at 6 and 20 cm, as well as archived ROSAT X-ray data, previously published optical results, and our own Hα image, we have searched for X-ray and radio counterparts to previously known optically identified SNRs and for new previously unidentified SNRs at these two wavelength regimes. Consistent with our prior results for NGC 300, only a tiny minority of the optically identified SNRs have been found at another wavelength. The most noteworthy source in our study is N7793-S26, which is the only SNR in this galaxy that is detected at all three wavelengths (X-ray, optical, and radio). It features a long (~450 pc) filamentary morphology that is clearly seen in both the optical and the radio images. N7793-S26's radio luminosity exceeds that of the Galactic SNR Cas A, and based on equipartition calculations we determine that an energy of at least 1052 ergs is required to maintain this source. Such a result argues for the source being created by multiple supernova explosions rather than by a single supernova event. A second optically identified SNR, N7793-S11, has detectable radio emission but no detectable X-ray emission. A radio-selected sample of candidate SNRs has also been prepared by searching for coincidences between nonthermal radio sources and regions of Hα emission in this galaxy. This search has produced five new candidate radio SNRs to be added to the 28 SNRs that have already been detected by optical methods. A complementary search for new candidate X-ray SNRs has also been conducted by searching for soft-spectrum sources (kT < 1 keV) that are coincident with regions of Hα emission. That search has yielded a candidate X-ray SNR that is coincident with one (and possibly two) of the candidate radio SNRs, but considerable diffuse X-ray emission throughout the disk of NGC 7793 reduces the efficacy of the search. Like NGC 300, very little overlap in identifications is seen between the SNRs found through X-ray, optical, and radio methods, and such a result argues for the role played by distance-dependent selection effects in determining the detectability of SNRs. In addition, we find that the density of the ambient interstellar medium (ISM) surrounding SNRs significantly impacts the spectral characteristics of the SNRs in this galaxy, consistent with surveys of the SNR populations in other galaxies.", "Titre": "An X-Ray, Optical, and Radio Search for Supernova Remnants in the Nearby Sculptor Group Sd Galaxy NGC 7793", "Type": "Journal article", "LienPDF": "/article/10.1086/337918/pdf", "doi": "10.1086/337918"}, {"Id": 266, "Autheur": "P.

Searches have been conducted for both pure (fully cloaked) and partial Dyson spheres in the blackbody temperature region 100 K ≤ T ≤ 600 K. When other stellar signatures that resemble a Dyson sphere are used to eliminate sources that mimic Dyson spheres very few candidates remain and even these are ambiguous. Upper limits are presented for both pure and partial Dyson spheres.

The sources are radio bright, have no identifications or optical source coincidences, are more than 5% linearly polarized, and are spatially unresolved in the catalog. If these sources are fast-spinning pulsars (e.g., sub-millisecond pulsars), previous large-scale pulsar surveys may have missed detection due to instrumental and computational limitations, eclipsing effects, or diffractive scintillation. The discovery of a sub-millisecond pulsar would significantly constrain the neutron star equation of state and would have implications for models predicting a rapid slowdown of highly recycled X-ray pulsars to millisecond periods from, e.g., accretion disk decoupling. These same sources were previously searched unsuccessfully for pulsations at 610 MHz with the Lovell Telescope at Jodrell Bank. This new search was conducted at a different epoch with a new 800 MHz backend on the NRAO 43 m Telescope at a center frequency of 1200 MHz. Our search was sensitive to sub-millisecond pulsars in highly accelerated binary systems and to short transient pulses. No periodic or transient signals were detected from any of the target sources. We conclude that diffractive scintillation, dispersive smearing, and binary acceleration are unlikely to have prevented detection of the large majority of the sources if they are pulsars, though we cannot rule out eclipsing, nulling or intermittent emission, or radio interference as possible factors for some non-detections.

The larger the shift of the pattern relative to the string in case of pattern and string characters' mismatch is, the higher is the algorithm running speed. This article offers a combined algorithm, which has been developed on the basis of well-known Knuth-Morris-Pratt and Boyer-Moore string searching algorithms.

The aim of these observations was to detect the underlying galaxies and search for their redshifted [O II] λ3727 emission and optical/near-IR continuum. Candidate absorber galaxies separated by 25-88 from the quasars are detected in two of three absorber fields in the H and KS\n bands at >3σ level. The potentially high success rate in finding galaxy counterparts of metal-rich absorbers suggests that the metal-rich absorbers may be easier to detect in imaging observations than the metal-poor absorbers targeted in many previous imaging studies of damped Lyα absorbers. Of course, spectroscopic confirmation of the candidate galaxies is necessary to establish whether they are at the absorber redshifts. Interestingly, no significant [O II] emission is detected in any of the fields at >3σ level, implying limits on the star formation rate (SFR) of 0.7-2.6 M\n☉ yr–1 per 076 × 076 region, if no dust extinction is assumed.

If the candidate galaxies are at the absorber redshifts, the lack of [O II] emission would suggest that the metal-rich absorbers may arise in early-type or S0 galaxies that do not have significant \"current\" star formation.

In previous work using the Spitzer Space Telescope, we found evidence to support at least one sub-Earth-sized exoplanet orbiting the nearby mid-M dwarf star GJ 436. As a follow up, here we used the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to investigate the existence of one of these candidate planets, UCF-1.01, by searching for two transit signals as it passed in front of its host star. Interpretation of the data hinges critically on correctly modeling and removing the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) instrument systematics from the light curves. Building on previous HST work, we demonstrate that WFC3 analyses need to explore the use of a quadratic function to fit a visit-long time-dependent systematic. This is important for establishing absolute transit and eclipse depths in the white light curves of all transiting systems. The work presented here exemplifies this point by putatively detecting the primary transit of UCF-1.01 with the use of a linear trend. However, using a quadratic trend, we achieve a better fit to the white light curves and a reduced transit depth that is inconsistent with previous Spitzer measurements. Furthermore, quadratic trends with or without a transit model component produce comparable fits to the available data. Using extant WFC3 transit light curves for GJ 436b, we further validate the quadratic model component by achieving photon-limited model fit residuals and consistent transit depths over multiple epochs. We conclude that, when we fit for a quadratic trend, our new data contradict the prediction of a sub-Earth-sized planet orbiting GJ 436 with the size, period, and ephemeris posited from the Spitzer data by a margin of 3.1σ.", "Titre": "A Hubble Space Telescope Search for a Sub-Earth-sized Exoplanet in the GJ 436 System", "Type": "Journal article", "LienPDF": "/article/10.1088/0004-637X/796/1/32/pdf", "doi": "10.1088/0004-637X/796/1/32"}, {"Id": 279, "Autheur": "Rychard J.

At 2.4 R\n⊕, Kepler-22b is too large to be considered an Earth analog, but should the planet host a moon large enough to maintain an atmosphere, then the Kepler-22 system may yet possess a telluric world. Aside from being within the habitable zone, the target is attractive due to the availability of previously measured precise radial velocities and low intrinsic photometric noise, which has also enabled asteroseismology studies of the star. For these reasons, Kepler-22b was selected as a target-of-opportunity by the \"Hunt for Exomoons with Kepler\" (HEK) project. In this work, we conduct a photodynamical search for an exomoon around Kepler-22b leveraging the transits, radial velocities, and asteroseismology plus several new tools developed by the HEK project to improve exomoon searches.

We discuss torsion, Poincaré gauge theories, teleparallel theories, metric-affine connection theories and pseudoscalar (axion) theories. We discuss laboratory searches for electron and nucleus spin couplings—the weak equivalence principle experiments for polarized bodies, the finite-range spin-coupling experiments, the spin–spin coupling experiments and the cosmic-spin coupling experiments. The role played by angular momentum and rotation is explicitly discussed. We discuss astrophysical and cosmological searches for photon-polarization coupling. An investigation on the implications and interrelations of equivalence principles led to a possible pseudoscalar or vector interaction, and led to the proposal of weak equivalence principle II (WEP II) which includes rotation in the universal free-fall motion. Evidence for WEP II is discussed and compiled. Cosmological searches for photon-polarization coupling test the possibility of violation of Einstein's equivalence principle and the existence of cosmic pseudoscalar/vector interaction and may reveal a potential influence to our presently observed universe from a larger arena. In relativistic gravity, there is a Lense–Thirring frame dragging on a rotating body with angular momentum. Analogous to gyromagnetic ratio in electromagnetism, one can define gyrogravitational ratio.

Depending on the substructure of the DM halo of a galaxy cluster and the cross sections for DM annihilation channels, these signals might be detectable by the latest generation of γ-ray telescopes. Here we use three years of Fermi-Large Area Telescope data, which are the most suitable for searching for very extended emission in the vicinity of the nearby Virgo galaxy cluster. Our analysis reveals statistically significant extended emission which can be well characterized by a uniformly emitting disk profile with a radius of 3° that moreover is offset from the cluster center. We demonstrate that the significance of this extended emission strongly depends on the adopted interstellar emission model (IEM) and is most likely an artifact of our incomplete description of the IEM in this region. We also search for and find new point source candidates in the region. We then derive conservative upper limits on the velocity-averaged DM pair annihilation cross section from Virgo. We take into account the potential γ-ray flux enhancement due to DM sub-halos and its complex morphology as a merging cluster. For DM annihilating into  assuming a conservative sub-halo model setup, we find limits that are between 1 and 1.5 orders of magnitude above the expectation from the thermal cross section for mDM  100 GeV. In a more optimistic scenario, we exclude  for mDM  40 GeV for the same channel. Finally, we derive upper limits on the γ-ray-flux produced by hadronic cosmic-ray interactions in the inter cluster medium.

This method is based on the infrared colors of the recent Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) all-sky survey. In this Letter, we applied our new association method to the case of unidentified INTEGRAL sources (UISs) listed in the fourth soft gamma-ray source catalog.

Finally, we analyzed Swift archival data available for 10 out of these 18 γ-ray blazar candidates, and we found that 7 out of 10 are clearly detected in soft X-rays and/or in the optical-ultraviolet band. We cannot confirm the associations between the UISs and the selected γ-ray blazar candidates due to the discrepancies between the INTEGRAL and the soft X-ray spectra.

Recent modeling of the explosions suggests a significant diversity in the key natal properties—rotation rate, velocity, and magnetic field strength—of the resulting neutron stars that account for the association of active radio pulsars, pulsar wind nebulae, and magnetars with supernova remnants (SNRs). The discovery of a central X-ray source in Cas A, the youngest known Galactic SNR, dramatized the expected diversity. However, less than half of the SNRs within 5 kpc have identified central sources, and only three are identified as the remnants of Type Ia SNe. Here we report a systematic effort to search for compact central sources in the remaining 23 SNRs of this distance limited sample. Our search was inspired, on empirical considerations, by the enigmatic faint X-ray source in Cas A; motivated, on theoretical grounds, by the expectation that young neutron stars emit cooling X-ray emission; and made possible by the superb angular resolution offered by the Chandra X-ray mission and the sensitivity of the XMM-Newton mission.     In this first paper we report Chandra observations of four SNRs (G093.3+6.9, G315.4-2.3, G084.2+0.8, and G127.1+0.5). We have undertaken a systematic optical/IR identification program of the X-ray sources detected in the field of each SNR. Foreground (flare stars, active stars) and background (active galactic nuclei) sources have identifiable IR/optical counterparts. In contrast, the counterparts of neutron stars (or black holes) are expected to be very faint. We are able to account for all the well-detected X-ray sources and thus able to state with some confidence that there are no associated central sources down to a level of one-tenth of that of the Cas A central source, LX  1031 ergs s-1. We compare our limits with cooling curves for neutron stars and find that any putative neutron stars in these SNRs must be cooling faster than expected for traditional 1.35 M⊙ neutron stars and that any putative pulsar must have low spin-down luminosities   1034 ergs s-1. However, our limits are unable to constrain the presence or absence of more unusual options, such as relatively more massive neutron stars with M  1.45 M⊙, neutron stars with exotic interiors, or quiescent black holes.

Until now, WHIM surveys via BLAs have been no less ambiguous than those via far-UV and X-ray metal-ion probes. Detecting these weak, broad features requires background sources with a well-characterized far-UV continuum and data of very high quality. However, a recent Hubble Space Telescope/Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) observation of the z = 0.03 blazar Mrk 421 allows us to perform a metal-independent search for WHIM gas with unprecedented precision. The data have high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N ≈ 50 per ~20 km s–1 resolution element) and the smooth, power-law blazar spectrum allows a fully parametric continuum model. We analyze the Mrk 421 sight line for BLA absorbers, particularly for counterparts to the proposed O VII WHIM systems reported by Nicastro et al. based on Chandra/Low Energy Transmission Grating observations. We derive the Lyα profiles predicted by the X-ray observations. The S/N of the COS data is high (S/N ≈ 25 pixel-1), but much higher S/N can be obtained by binning the data to widths characteristic of the expected BLA profiles. With this technique, we are sensitive to WHIM gas over a large (N\nH, T) parameter range in the Mrk 421 sight line. We rule out the claimed Nicastro et al. O VII detections at their nominal temperatures (T ~ 1-2 × 106 K) and metallicities (Z = 0.1 Z\n☉) at  2σ level.

Grid search method has some advantages they are: it can relocate the hypocenter more accurate because this method is dividing space lattice model into blocks, and each grid block can only be occupied by one point hypocenter. Tomography technique is done by travel time data that has had relocated with inversion pseudo bending method. Grid search relocated method show that the hypocenter's depth is shallower than before and the direction is to the south, the hypocenter distribution is modeled into the subduction zone between the continent of Eurasia with the Indo-Australian with an average angle of 14 °. The tomography results show the low velocity value is contained under volcanoes with value of -8% to -10%, then the pattern of the main fault structure in Central Java can be description by the results of tomography at high velocity that is from 8% to 10% with the direction is northwest and northeast-southwest.", "Titre": "Earthquake effect on volcano and the geological structure in central java using tomography travel time method and relocation hypocenter by grid search method", "Type": "Journal article", "LienPDF": "/article/10.1088/1742-6596/776/1/012117/pdf", "doi": "10.1088/1742-6596/776/1/012117"}, {"Id": 312, "Autheur": "Avishay Gal-Yam, D.

The massive stars exploding as hydrogen-deficient core-collapse supernovae should have lost their outer hydrogen envelopes prior to their explosion, either through winds—such stars are identified within our Galaxy as Wolf-Rayet (W-R) stars—or to a binary companion. The luminosity limits we set rule out more than half of the known Galactic W-R stars as possible progenitors of this event. In particular, they imply that a W-R progenitor should have been among the more evolved (highly stripped, less luminous) of these stars, a concrete constraint on its evolutionary state just prior to core collapse. The possibility of a less luminous, lower mass binary progenitor cannot be constrained.

State-of-the-art experiments for studying neural processes underlying visual cognition often constrain sensory inputs (e.g., static images) and our behavior (e.g., fixed eye-gaze, long eye fixations), isolating or simplifying the interaction of neural processes. Motivated by the non-stationarity of our natural visual environment, we investigated the electroencephalography (EEG) correlates of visual recognition while participants overtly performed visual search in non-stationary scenes. We hypothesized that visual effects (such as those typically used in human–computer interfaces) may increase temporal uncertainty (with reference to fixation onset) of cognition-related EEG activity in an active search task and therefore require novel techniques for single-trial detection. Approach. We addressed fixation-related EEG activity in an active search task with respect to stimulus-appearance styles and dynamics. Alongside popping-up  stimuli, our experimental study embraces two composite appearance styles based on fading-in, enlarging, and motion  effects. Additionally, we explored whether the knowledge obtained in the pop-up  experimental setting can be exploited to boost the EEG-based intention-decoding performance when facing transitional changes of visual content. Main results. The results confirmed our initial hypothesis that the dynamic of visual content can increase temporal uncertainty of the cognition-related EEG activity in active search with respect to fixation onset. This temporal uncertainty challenges the pivotal aim to keep the decoding performance constant irrespective of visual effects. Importantly, the proposed approach for EEG decoding based on knowledge transfer between the different experimental settings gave a promising performance. Significance. Our study demonstrates that the non-stationarity of visual scenes is an important factor in the evolution of cognitive processes, as well as in the dynamic of ocular behavior (i.e., dwell time and fixation duration) in an active search task.

We looked for the characteristic circular polarization (Stokes V) pattern in strong emission lines that would arise as a consequence of a global, rotating magnetic field with a split monopole configuration. We also obtained nearly simultaneous linear polarization spectra (Stokes Q and U), which are dominated by electron scattering, most likely from a flattened wind with large-scale corotating structures. As the star rotates with a period of 3.766 days, our view of the wind changes, which in turn affects the value of the linear polarization in lines versus continuum at the ~0.2% level. Depending on the epoch of observation, our Stokes V data were affected by significant crosstalk from Stokes Q and U to V. We removed this spurious signal from the circular polarization data and experimented with various levels of spectral binning to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of our data. In the end, no magnetic field is unambiguously detected in EZ CMa.

A search model is presented that applies to situations, as in the free-response paradigm, where on each image the number of normal regions that could be mistaken for lesions is unknown, and the number of observer generated localizations of suspicious regions (marks) is unpredictable. The search model is based on a two-stage model that has been proposed in the literature, according to which, at the first stage (the preattentive stage) the observer uses mainly peripheral vision to identify likely lesion candidates, and at the second stage the observer decides (i.e., cognitively evaluates) whether or not to report the candidates. The search model regards the unpredictable numbers of lesion and non-lesion localizations as random variables and models them via appropriate statistical distributions. The model has three parameters quantifying the lesion signal-to-noise ratio, the observer's expertise at rejecting non-lesion locations, and the observer's expertise at finding lesions. A figure-of-merit quantifying the observer's search performance is described. The search model bears a close resemblance to the initial detection and candidate analysis (IDCA) model that has been recently proposed for analysing computer aided detection (CAD) algorithms.

The aim of this work is to relate the search model parameters to receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves that would result if the observer reported the rating of the most suspicious finding on an image as the overall rating. Also presented are the probability density functions (pdfs) of the underlying latent decision variables corresponding to the highest rating for normal and abnormal images. The search-model-predicted ROC curves are 'proper' in the sense of never crossing the chance diagonal and the slope is monotonically changing. They also have the interesting property of not allowing the observer to move the operating point continuously from the origin to (1, 1). For certain choices of parameters the operating points are predicted to be clustered near the initial steep region of the curve, as has been observed by other investigators. The pdfs are non-Gaussians, markedly so for the abnormal images and for certain choices of parameter values, and provide an explanation for the well-known observation that experimental ROC data generally imply a wider pdf for abnormal images than for normal images.

In particular, the proximity and proposed dark matter content of the Smith Cloud make it a tempting target for the indirect detection of dark matter annihilation. We argue that the Smith Cloud may be a better target than some Milky Way dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies and use γ-ray observations from the Fermi Large Area Telescope to search for a dark matter annihilation signal. No significant γ-ray excess is found coincident with the Smith Cloud, and we set strong limits on the dark matter annihilation cross section assuming a spatially extended dark matter profile consistent with dynamical modeling of the Smith Cloud. Notably, these limits exclude the canonical thermal relic cross section (~ 3 × 10–26 cm3 s–1) for dark matter masses  30 GeV annihilating via the  or τ+τ– channels for certain assumptions of the dark matter density profile; however, uncertainties in the dark matter content of the Smith Cloud may significantly weaken these constraints.", "Titre": "Searching for Dark Matter Annihilation in the Smith High-velocity Cloud", "Type": "Journal article", "LienPDF": "/article/10.1088/0004-637X/790/1/24/pdf", "doi": "10.1088/0004-637X/790/1/24"}, {"Id": 334, "Autheur": "Q.

Observed metal-poor halo stars preserved this pattern by exhibiting abundance ratios [α/Fe] ~+0.4. A few striking exceptions that show severe departures from the general enhanced α-element chemical abundance trends of the halo have been discovered in recent years. They possess relatively low [α/Fe] compared to other comparable-metallicity stars, with abundance ratios over 0.5 dex lower. These stars may have a different chemical enrichment history from the majority of the halo. Similarly, low-α abundances are also displayed by satellite dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies. We present a method to select extremely α-poor (EAP) stars from the SDSS/SEGUE survey. The method consists of a two-step approach. In the first step, we select suspected metal-poor ([Fe/H] <–0.5) and α-poor ([Mg/Fe] <0) stars as our targets. In the second step, we determine [Mg/Fe] from low-resolution (R = 2000) stellar spectra for our targets and select stars with [Mg/Fe] <–0.1 as candidate EAP stars. In a sample of 40,000 stars with atmospheric parameters in the range of T\neff = [4500, 7000] K, log g = [1.0, 5.0], and [Fe/H] = [–4.0, +0.5], 14 candidate stars were identified.

At z = 3.200 ± 0.001, this water emission feature is redshifted to 43.6 GHz. Unlike the faint rotational transitions of HCN (the standard high-density tracer at high z), H2O (313 → 220) is observed with high maser amplification factors in Galactic star-forming regions. It therefore holds the potential to trace high-density star-forming regions in the distant universe. If indeed all star-forming regions in massively star-forming galaxies at z > 3 have physical properties similar to those of, e.g., the Orion or W49N molecular cloud cores, the flux ratio between the maser-amplified H2O (313 → 220) and the thermally excited 12CO (J = 1 → 0) transitions may be as high as factor of 20 (but has to be corrected by their relative filling factor). MG 0751+2716 is a strong 12CO (J = 4 → 3) emitter, and therefore one of the most suitable targets to search for H2O (313 → 220) at cosmological redshifts. Our search resulted in an upper limit in line luminosity of L < 0.6 × 109 K km s-1 pc2. Assuming a brightness temperature of Tb(H2O)  500 K for the maser emission and CO properties from the literature, this translates to a H2O (313 → 220)/12CO (J = 4 → 3) area filling factor of less than 1%. However, this limit is not valid if the H2O (313 → 220) maser emission is quenched, i.e., if the line is only thermally excited. We conclude that, if our results were to hold for other high-z sources, H2O does not appear to be a more luminous alternative to HCN to detect high-density gas in star-forming environments at high redshift.", "Titre": "A Search for H2O in the Strongly Lensed QSO MG 0751+2716 at z = 3.2", "Type": "Journal article", "LienPDF": "/article/10.1086/506012/pdf", "doi": "10.1086/506012"}, {"Id": 336, "Autheur": "J.

The burst mechanism might involve crustal fractures and excitation of non-radial modes which would emit gravitational waves (GWs). We present the results of a search for GW bursts from six galactic magnetars that is sensitive to neutron star f-modes, thought to be the most efficient GW emitting oscillatory modes in compact stars. One of them, SGR 0501+4516, is likely ~1 kpc from Earth, an order of magnitude closer than magnetars targeted in previous GW searches. A second, AXP 1E 1547.0–5408, gave a burst with an estimated isotropic energy >1044 erg which is comparable to the giant flares. We find no evidence of GWs associated with a sample of 1279 electromagnetic triggers from six magnetars occurring between 2006 November and 2009 June, in GW data from the LIGO, Virgo, and GEO600 detectors.

Complex H is a large (Ω  400 deg2) and probably nearby (d = 27 kpc) HVC whose location in the Galactic plane has hampered previous investigations of its stellar content. The H I mass of the cloud is 2.0 × 107(d/27 kpc)2 M☉, making complex H one of the most massive HVCs if its distance is more than ~20 kpc. Virtually all similar H I clouds in other galaxy groups are associated with low surface brightness dwarf galaxies. We selected mid-infrared sources observed by the MSX satellite in the direction of complex H that appeared likely to be star-forming regions and observed them at the wavelength of the CO J = 1 → 0 rotational transition in order to determine their velocities. Of the 60 observed sources, 59 show emission at Milky Way velocities, and we detected no emission at velocities consistent with that of complex H. We use these observations to set an upper limit on the ongoing star formation rate in the HVC of 5 × 10-4 M☉ yr-1. We also searched the 2MASS database for evidence of any dwarf-galaxy-like stellar population in the direction of the HVC and found no trace of a distant red giant population, with an upper limit on the stellar mass of ~106 M☉. Given the lack of evidence for either current star formation or an evolved population, we conclude that complex H cannot be a dwarf galaxy with properties similar to those of known dwarfs. Complex H is therefore one of the most massive known H I clouds that does not contain any stars. If complex H is self-gravitating, then this object is one of the few known dark galaxy candidates. These findings may offer observational support for the idea that the cold dark matter substructure problem is related to the difficulty of forming stars in low-mass dark matter halos; alternatively, complex H could be an example of a cold accretion flow onto the Milky Way.", "Titre": "The Cosmological Significance of High-Velocity Cloud Complex H", "Type": "Journal article", "LienPDF": "/article/10.1086/499914/pdf", "doi": "10.1086/499914"}, {"Id": 338, "Autheur": "Bryce Croll, Jaymie M.

The method starts with calculating the initial location and radius of an initial circular search scope. The location is the center of the circle based on an approximate least-squares method of all measurement data points uniformly sampled around the circle, and the radius is the circularity error value by using the approximate center as the datum center of two concentric circles enclosing all measurement data points. Then the circular search scope was divided according to some concentric circles and radials with some radius and angle step lengths. Intersections of the circles and radials were candidate centers for circularity evaluation under the minimum zone criteria. An optimal center with minimum circularity error value was picked out as a new location of the search scope. The distance from the old location was the radius of the new search scope. Further it was divided and the intersections were evaluated until the optimal solution was met. Some examples in the literature were used to verify the validity of this method. The results are the same as or better than those minimum zone solutions adopted from previous work, and computation time is no more than 0.07 s implementing on an IBM ThinkPad R40 laptop for all examples.

Our search method employs a hierarchical template-grid-based exploration of the parameter space. In the first stage, candidate sources are identified in searches using different simulated laser signal combinations (known as TDI variables). Since each source generates a primary maximum near its true 'Doppler parameters' (intrinsic frequency and sky position) as well as numerous secondary maxima of the -statistic in Doppler parameter space, a search for multiple sources needs to distinguish between true signals and secondary maxima associated with other 'louder' signals. Our method does this by applying a coincidence test to reject candidates which are not found at nearby parameter space positions in searches using each of the three TDI variables. For signals surviving the coincidence test, we perform a fully coherent search over a refined parameter grid to provide an accurate parameter estimation for the final candidates. Suitably tuned, the pipeline is able to extract 1989 true signals with only 5 false alarms. The use of the rigid adiabatic approximation allows recovery of signal parameters with errors comparable to statistical expectations, although there is still some systematic excess with respect to statistical errors expected from Gaussian noise.

In these scenarios hadronic interactions give rise to neutral pions which decay into γ rays that are potentially observable with the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi space telescope. We present a joint likelihood analysis searching for spatially extended γ-ray emission at the locations of 50 galaxy clusters in four years of Fermi-LAT data under the assumption of the universal cosmic-ray (CR) model proposed by Pinzke & Pfrommer. We find an excess at a significance of 2.7σ, which upon closer inspection, however, is correlated to individual excess emission toward three galaxy clusters: A400, A1367, and A3112. We discuss these cases in detail and conservatively attribute the emission to unmodeled background systems (for example, radio galaxies within the clusters).Through the combined analysis of 50 clusters, we exclude hadronic injection efficiencies in simple hadronic models above 21% and establish limits on the CR to thermal pressure ratio within the virial radius, R\n200, to be below 1.25%-1.4% depending on the morphological classification.

The search was motivated by the report from Ruf et al. of the detection of non-thermal microwave radiation from Mars characterized by peaks in the power spectrum of the kurtosis, or kurtstrum, at 10 Hz, coinciding with a large dust storm event on 2006 June 8. For these observations, we developed a wideband signal processor at the Center for Astronomy Signal Processing and Electronics Research. This 1024 channel spectrometer calculates the accumulated power and power-squared, from which the spectral kurtosis is calculated post-observation. Variations in the kurtosis are indicative of non-Gaussianity in the signal, which can be used to detect variable cosmic signals as well as radio frequency interference (RFI). During the three-month period of observations, dust activity occurred on Mars in the form of small-scale dust storms; however, no signals indicating lightning discharge were detected. Frequent signals in the kurtstrum that contain spectral peaks with an approximate 10 Hz fundamental were seen at both 3.2 and 8.0 GHz, but were the result of narrowband RFI with harmonics spread over a broad frequency range.", "Titre": "The Allen Telescope Array Search for Electrostatic Discharges on Mars", "Type": "Journal article", "LienPDF": "/article/10.1088/0004-637X/744/1/15/pdf", "doi": "10.1088/0004-637X/744/1/15"}, {"Id": 360, "Autheur": "R.

However, contrary to the Crab, no firm detection of the Vela PWN in optical has been reported yet. To search for the optical counterpart of the X-ray PWN, we analyzed deep optical observations performed with different telescopes. We compared the optical images with those obtained with the Chandra ACIS to search for extended emission patterns that could be identified as counterparts of the X-ray nebula elements. Although some features are seen in the optical images, we find no correlation with the X-ray structure. Thus, we conclude that the diffuse optical emission is more likely associated with filaments in the host Vela supernova remnant.

During seven days of monitoring 229,293 stars brighter than V = 29.5, we find evidence for flaring activity in 105 stars between V = 20 and V = 28. We divided the sample into non-variable stars and variable stars whose light curves contain large-scale variability. The flare rate on variable stars is ~700 times that of non-variable stars, with a significant correlation between the amount of underlying stellar variability and peak flare amplitude. The flare energy loss rates are generally higher than those of nearby well-studied single dMe flare stars. The distribution of proper motions is consistent with the flaring stars being at the distance and age of the Galactic bulge. If they are single dwarfs, then they span a range of ≈1.0-0.25 M\n☉. A majority of the flaring stars exhibit periodic photometric modulations with P < 3 days. If these are tidally locked magnetically active binary systems, then their fraction in the bulge is enhanced by a factor of ∼20 compared to the local value. These stars may be useful for placing constraints on the angular momentum evolution of cool close binary stars.

Track-like muon events produced in neutrino interactions satisfy these requirements. We present here the results of searches for point-like sources with neutrinos using data acquired by the IceCube detector over 7 yr from 2008 to 2015. The discovery potential of the analysis in the northern sky is now significantly below  = 10−12 TeV cm−2 s−1, on average 38% lower than the sensitivity of the previously published analysis of 4 yr exposure.

A search has been performed for highly inclined extensive air showers produced by the interaction of neutrinos of all flavors in the atmosphere (downward-going neutrinos), and by the decay of tau leptons originating from tau neutrino interactions in Earth's crust (Earth-skimming neutrinos). No candidate neutrinos have been found in data up to 2010 May 31.

Clusterrank helped us discover 14 pulsars and 8 RRATs in data from the Arecibo 327 MHz Drift Pulsar Survey (AO327).

In comparing statistics of the new RRATs with sources from the RRATalog, we find that both sets are drawn from the same period distribution. In contrast, we find that the period distribution of the new pulsars is different from the period distributions of canonical pulsars in the ATNF catalog or pulsars found in AO327 data by a periodicity search.

Young stars are likely to have much stronger stellar winds than the Sun, and because planetary magnetospheric emissions are powered by stellar winds, stronger stellar winds may enhance the radio luminosity of any orbiting planets. Using various stellar catalogs, we selected nearby stars (30 pc) with relatively young age estimates (<3 Gyr). We constructed different samples from the stellar catalogs, finding between 100 and several hundred stars. We stacked images from the 74 MHz (4 m wavelength) VLA Low-frequency Sky Survey, obtaining 3σ limits on planetary emission in the stacked images of between 10 and 33 mJy. These flux density limits correspond to average planetary luminosities less than 5-10 ×1023 erg s–1. Using recent models for the scaling of stellar wind velocity, density, and magnetic field with stellar age, we estimate scaling factors for the strength of stellar winds, relative to the Sun, in our samples. The typical kinetic energy carried by the stellar winds in our samples is 15-50 times larger than that of the Sun, and the typical magnetic energy is 5-10 times larger. If we assume that every star is orbited by a Jupiter-like planet with a luminosity larger than that of the Jovian decametric radiation by the above factors, our limits on planetary luminosities from the stacking analysis are likely to be a factor of 10-100 above what would be required to detect the planets in a statistical sense.

While occultation surveys will probe the low-radius limit and imaging surveys will detect KBOs of size 100 km or more, statistics of objects with sizes in the intermediate range of around 1-100 km will likely remain unattainable.", "Titre": "Occultation Searches for Kuiper Belt Objects", "Type": "Journal article", "LienPDF": "/article/10.1086/375288/pdf", "doi": "10.1086/375288"}, {"Id": 383, "Autheur": "Jian Li, Diego F.

Using X-ray observations from ASCA, XMM-Newton, Chandra, Swift, Suzaku, and NuSTAR, spanning 20 years, we substantially extend and improve the spin ephemeris of AE Aqr. Using this ephemeris, we searched for gamma-ray pulsations at the spin period of the WD. No gamma-ray pulsations were detected above 3σ significance. Neither phase-averaged gamma-ray emission nor gamma-ray variability of AE Aqr is detected by Fermi LAT.

We searched for sequences of quasi-equally spaced frequencies, containing at least four members per sequence, in 90 δ Scuti stars observed by CoRoT. We found an unexpectedly large number of independent series of regular frequency spacing in 77 δ Scuti stars (from one to eight sequences) in the non-asymptotic regime. We introduce the sequence search method presenting the sequences and echelle diagram of CoRoT 102675756 and the structure of the algorithmic search. Four sequences (echelle ridges) were found in the 5–21 d−1 region where the pairs of the sequences are shifted (between 0.5 and 0.59 d−1) by twice the value of the estimated rotational splitting frequency (0.269 d−1). The general conclusions for the whole sample are also presented in this paper. The statistics of the spacings derived by the sequence search method, by FT (Fourier transform of the frequencies), and the statistics of the shifts are also compared. In many stars more than one almost equally valid spacing appeared. The model frequencies of FG Vir and their rotationally split components were used to formulate the possible explanation that one spacing is the large separation while the other is the sum of the large separation and the rotational frequency. In CoRoT 102675756, the two spacings (2.249 and 1.977 d−1) are in better agreement with the sum of a possible 1.710 d−1 large separation and two or one times, respectively, the value of the rotational frequency.", "Titre": "Unexpected Series of Regular Frequency Spacing of δ Scuti Stars in the Non-asymptotic Regime.

Other quantum correlations such as quantum discord are also useful to capture some important properties of the nonclassical correlation. Also there is no well-accepted and clear distinction between quantum correlations and classical correlations. In this paper, we systematically investigate several kinds of correlations including both quantum and classical in the whole process of the Grover search algorithm. These correlations are the concurrence, entanglement of formation, quantum discord, classical correlation and mutual information. The behaviors of quantum discord, classical correlation and mutual information are almost the same while the concurrence is different in the qubit–qubit case. For the qubit partition 1: n case, the behaviors of all correlations are qualitative the same.

The hypothesis we exploit is that large overabundances of carbon are common among metal-poor stars, as has been found by numerous studies over the past two decades. The selection was made by considering two line indices in the 4300 Å region, applied directly to the low-resolution prism spectra. This work also extends a previously published method by adding bright sources to the sample. The spectra of these stars suffer from saturation effects, compromising the index calculations and leading to an undersampling of the brighter candidates. A simple numerical procedure, based on available photometry, was developed to correct the line indices and overcome this limitation. Visual inspection and classification of the spectra from the HES plates yielded a list of 5288 new metal-poor (and by selection, carbon-rich) candidates, which are presently being used as targets for medium-resolution spectroscopic follow-up. Estimates of the stellar atmospheric parameters, as well as carbon abundances, are now available for 117 of the first candidates, based on follow-up medium-resolution spectra obtained with the SOAR 4.1 m and Gemini 8 m telescopes. We demonstrate that our new method improves the metal-poor star fractions found by our pilot study by up to a factor of three in the same magnitude range, as compared with our pilot study based on only one CH G-band index. Our selection scheme obtained roughly a 40% success rate for identification of stars with [Fe/H] <–1.0; the primary contaminant is late-type stars with near-solar abundances and, often, emission line cores that filled in the Ca II K line on the prism spectrum. Because the selection is based on carbon, we greatly increase the numbers of known carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars from the HES with intermediate metallicities –2.0 < [Fe/H] <–1.0, which previous survey efforts undersampled. There are eight newly discovered stars with [Fe/H] <–3.0 in our sample, including two with [Fe/H] <–3.5.", "Titre": "Searches for Metal-poor Stars from the Hamburg/ESO Survey Using the CH G Band", "Type": "Journal article", "LienPDF": "/article/10.1088/0004-6256/142/6/188/pdf", "doi": "10.1088/0004-6256/142/6/188"}, {"Id": 388, "Autheur": "Aaron E.

Down to surface brightness limits of μ\nB\n = 30.1 and μ\nV\n = 29.5, we find no diffuse, large-scale optical counterpart to the \"Leo Ring,\" an extended H I ring surrounding the central elliptical M105 (NGC 3379). However, we do find a number of extremely low surface brightness (μ\nB\n  29) small-scale streamlike features, possibly tidal in origin, two of which may be associated with the Ring. In addition, we present detailed surface photometry of each of the group's most massive members—M105, NGC 3384, M96 (NGC 3368), and M95 (NGC 3351)—out to large radius and low surface brightness, where we search for signatures of interaction and accretion events. We find that the outer isophotes of both M105 and M95 appear almost completely undisturbed, in contrast to NGC 3384 which shows a system of diffuse shells indicative of a recent minor merger. We also find photometric evidence that M96 is accreting gas from the H I ring, in agreement with H I data. In general, however, interaction signatures in the M96 Group are extremely subtle for a group environment, and provide some tension with interaction scenarios for the formation of the Leo H I Ring. The lack of a significant component of diffuse intragroup starlight in the M96 Group is consistent with its status as a loose galaxy group in which encounters are relatively mild and infrequent.", "Titre": "Searching for Diffuse Light in the M96 Galaxy Group", "Type": "Journal article", "LienPDF": "/article/10.1088/0004-637X/791/1/38/pdf", "doi": "10.1088/0004-637X/791/1/38"}, {"Id": 389, "Autheur": "Hyron Spinrad and L.

Our Very Large Array (VLA) radio observations at 6 cm and 20 cm have been combined with previously published optical results, our own optical image, and archived ROSAT X-ray data to search for new SNR candidates. Of the 28 optically identified SNRs found by Blair & Long, three exhibit some combination of X-ray and radio emission, but in general X-ray and radio emission from the optically identified SNRs is undetected.\nA radio-selected sample of SNR candidates is constructed by searching for positional coincidences between nonthermal radio continuum sources and sources of Hα emission with the intent of finding SNRs that are typically overlooked using the [S II]/Hα criterion, i.e., those SNRs that are either confused by Hα emission or which are Balmer-dominated. This search has yielded 17 SNR candidates, of which 14 are new and three were already known from the optically selected sample. Four of the radio-selected candidates also possess detectable X-ray emission.\nA complementary analysis of the X-ray data has yielded an X-ray-selected sample of candidates consisting of six soft-spectrum sources (kT < 1 keV) coincident with regions of Hα emission. Two of these candidate X-ray SNRs are common to the radio-selected sample and two more are common to the optically selected sample. Thus, the X-ray selection has yielded two additional candidates.\nThrough a multiwavelength campaign, we have added sixteen new candidate SNRs to the 28 previously known SNRs for a total of 44 SNR candidates in NGC 300. The fact that these new candidates were missed in the optical surveys suggests a possible selection effect. SNRs identified through optical methods may represent only the SNRs located in regions with relatively low confusion from Hα emission, well away from star-forming regions. The SNRs in or near star-forming regions are more likely to be confused by emission from H II regions and are therefore more likely to be missed in optical surveys. The radio-selection process, on the other hand, suffers from a separate selection effect: it can only identify candidates if they are associated with H II regions, such that our sample of radio-selected SNRs is biased toward star-forming regions. Finally, the X-ray candidates are selected on the basis of having soft spectra and association with H II regions, so that the sample is biased against X-ray-emitting SNRs with hard spectra and no optical counterparts. The fact that the optically selected, radio-selected, and X-ray-selected data sets of SNR candidates have limited overlap is consistent with these opposing selection effects. We present a simulation to investigate the effects of optical confusion on a hypothetical optical survey for SNRs in a galaxy, using \"artificial\" SNRs that have been placed in a range of confused environments. We find that the detection of SNRs becomes increasingly difficult with distance, and that the most deeply embedded SNRs are not identified even in the nearest distance investigated.

UCHVCs have properties consistent with their being low-mass dwarf galaxies in the Local Volume, but do not have identified optical counterparts. We are using the WIYN 3.5 m telescope to image these objects and search for an associated stellar population. Here we present our observational strategy and method for searching for resolved stellar counterparts to the UCHVCs. We combine careful photometry, a color–magnitude filter, and spatial smoothing techniques to search for stellar overdensities in the g- and i-band images. We also run statistical tests to quantify the likelihood that detected overdensities are real and not chance superpositions of sources. We demonstrate the method by applying it to WIYN imaging of two objects: Leo P, a UCHVC discovered by ALFALFA and shown to be a star-forming dwarf galaxy in the Local Volume and AGC 198606, an ALFALFA source near in position and velocity to the Local Group dwarf galaxy Leo T. Applying the search method to the Leo P data yields an unambiguous detection (>99% confidence) of the galaxy's stellar population. Applying the method to the AGC 198606 imaging yields a possible detection (92% confidence) of an optical counterpart located ~2.5 arcmin from the centroid of AGC 198606's Hi distribution and within the Hi disk.

Our primary data set for this search is the two J110 + H160 NICMOS fields taken in parallel with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) Hubble Ultra Deep Field (UDF). The 5 σ limiting magnitudes were ~28.6 in J110 and ~28.5 in H160 (06 apertures). Several shallower fields were also used: J110 + H160 NICMOS frames available over the Hubble Deep Field (HDF) North, the HDF-South NICMOS parallel, and the ACS UDF (with 5 σ limiting magnitudes in J110 and H160 ranging from 27.0 to 28.2). The primary selection criterion was (J110-H160)AB > 1.8. Eleven such sources were found in all search fields using this criterion. Eight of these are clearly ruled out as credible z ≈ 10 sources, either as a result of detections (>2 σ) blueward of J110 or their colors redward of the break (H160-K ~ 1.5) (redder than 98% of lower redshift dropouts). The nature of the three remaining sources could not be determined from the data. This number appears consistent with the expected contamination from low-redshift interlopers. Analysis of the stacked images for the three candidates also suggests some contamination. Regardless of their true redshifts, the actual number of z ≈ 10 sources must be three or fewer. To assess the significance of these results, two lower redshift samples (a z ~ 3.8 B-dropout and z ~ 6 i-dropout sample) were projected to z ~ 7-13 using a (1 + z)-1 size scaling (for fixed luminosity). They were added to the image frames and the selection was repeated, giving 15.6 and 4.8 J110-dropouts, respectively. This suggests that to the limit of this probe (≈0.3L), there has been evolution from z ~ 3.8 and possibly from z ~ 6. This is consistent with the strong evolution already noted at z ~ 6 and z ~ 7.5 relative to z ~ 3-4.

Of the spectra with adequate signal-to-noise, 148 spectra exhibit a double-peaked [O III] profile. Of these, 86 are Type 1 AGNs and 62 are Type 2 AGNs. Only two give the appearance of possibly being optically resolved double AGNs in the SDSS images, but many show close companions or signs of recent interaction. Radio-detected quasars are three times more likely to exhibit a double-peaked [O III] profile than quasars with no detected radio flux, suggesting a role for jet interactions in producing the double-peaked profiles. Of the 66 broad-line (Type 1) AGNs that are undetected in the FIRST survey, 0.9% show double-peaked [O III] profiles. We discuss statistical tests of the nature of the double-peaked objects. Further study is needed to determine which of them are binary AGNs rather than disturbed narrow line regions, and how many additional binaries may remain undetected because of insufficient line-of-sight velocity splitting. Previous studies indicate that 0.1% of SDSS quasars are spatially resolved binaries, with typical spacings of ~10-100 kpc. If a substantial fraction of the double-peaked objects are indeed binaries, then our results imply that binaries occur more frequently at smaller separations (<10 kpc).

We find that the PC's point-spread function (PSF) is 3-4 times brighter over the angular range 2\"-5\" than the PSF expected for a perfect optical system. Azimuthal variations of the PC's PSF are 10-20 times larger than expected for a perfect PSF. These variations suggest that light is scattered nonuniformly from the surface of the detector. Because the anomalies in the PC's PSF cannot be precisely simulated, subtracting a reference PSF from the PC image is problematic. We have developed a computer algorithm that identifies local brightness anomalies within the PSF as potential FC's. We find that this search algorithm will successfully locate FC's anywhere within the circumstellar field provided that the average pixel signal from the FC is at least 10 sigma above the local background.

With this large pixel size (and with the even larger 30'' point-spread function [PSF] that we advocate) most bulge stars are unresolved, so one is in the regime of pixel lensing: microlensing and other forms of stellar variation are detected from the difference of pixel counts in successive images. We identify three principal uses of such a search. First, the observations are analogous to normal pixel lensing observations of the bulge of M31 but are carried out under conditions where the detected events can be followed up in detail. This permits crucial checks on the systematics of the M31 searches. Second, the search gives a complete inventory of bright bulge variables. Third, \"extreme microlensing events\" (EMEs) can be found in real time. EMEs are events with maximum magnifications Amax ~ 200 which, if they were observed intensively from two observatories, could yield the mass, distance, and speed of the gravitational lens. The instrumentation required to carry out the observations is inexpensive. The observations could be made in parallel with existing microlensing searches and/or follow-up observations.

Examination of timescales on the order of microseconds is possible because we used coherent dedispersion, a technique that has frequently been used for targeted observations, but has never been associated with a radio sky survey. The more usual technique, incoherent dedispersion, cannot resolve signals below a minimum timescale which depends on the signal's dispersion measure (DM) and frequency. However, coherent dedispersion requires more intensive computation than incoherent dedispersion. The required processing power was provided by BOINC, the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing. BOINC is a distributed computing system, allowing us to utilize hundreds of thousands of volunteers' computers to perform the necessary calculations for coherent dedispersion. Astrophysical events that might produce brief radio pulses include giant pulses from pulsars, rotating radio transients, exploding primordial black holes, or new sources yet to be imagined.

This search yielded 186 nuclear flares in galaxies, 2 of which are excellent TDF candidates. Because of the systematic nature of the search, the very large number of galaxies, the long time of observation, and the fact that non-TDFs were excluded without resorting to assumptions about TDF characteristics, this study provides an unparalleled opportunity to measure the TDF rate. To compute the rate of optical stellar tidal disruption events, we simulate our entire pipeline to obtain the efficiency of detection. The rate depends on the light curves of TDFs, which are presently still poorly constrained. Using only the observed part of the SDSS light curves gives a model-independent upper limit to the optical TDF rate,  (90% CL), under the assumption that the SDSS TDFs are representative examples. We develop three empirical models of the light curves based on the two SDSS light curves and two more recent and better-sampled Pan-STARRS TDF light curves, leading to our best estimate of the rate: . We explore the modeling uncertainties by considering two theoretically motivated light curve models, as well as two different relationships between black hole mass and galaxy luminosity, and two different treatments of the cutoff in the visibility of TDFs at large M\nBH. From this we conclude that these sources of uncertainty are not significantly larger than the statistical ones.

Subjects were cued to look toward the directions of these ROI using visual cues superimposed on the simulated prosthetic vision. Mobility tasks required the subjects to navigate through a corridor, avoid obstacles and locate a target at the end of the course. Two search task experiments involved finding objects on a tabletop under different conditions. Subjects were required to perform tasks with and without any help from cues. Results. Head movements, time to task completion and number of errors were all significantly reduced in search tasks when subjects used the cueing algorithm. For the mobility task, head movements and number of contacts with objects were significantly reduced when subjects used cues, whereas time was significantly reduced when no cues were used.

If one considers the brightest galaxies that produce ~50% of the light, then the number of galaxies inside typical GW error boxes will be several tens. We have found that this result applies both in the early years of Advanced LIGO when the range was small and the error boxes were large, and will apply in the later years when the error boxes will be small and the range will be large. This strategy has the beneficial property of reducing the number of telescope pointings by a factor of 10–100 compared with tiling the entire error box. Additional galaxy count reduction will come from a GW rapid distance estimate which will restrict the radial slice in search volume. Combining the bright galaxy strategy with a convolution based on anticipated GW localizations, we find that the searches can be restricted to about 18 ± 5 galaxies for 2015, about 23 ± 4 for 2017, and about 11 ± 2 for 2020. This assumes a distance localization at the putative neutron star–neutron star merger range μ for each target year, and these totals are integrated out to the range. Integrating out to the horizon would roughly double the totals. For localizations with  the totals would decrease.

The QAA is an analogue of simulated annealing, a classical numerical technique which has now been superseded. Hence, I explore two strategies to use an annealer in a way which takes advantage of modern classical optimization algorithms. Specifically, I show how sequential calls to quantum annealers can be used to construct analogues of population annealing and parallel tempering which use quantum searches as subroutines. The techniques given here can be applied not only to optimization, but also to sampling. I examine the feasibility of these protocols on real devices and note that implementing such protocols should require minimal if any change to the current design of the flux qubit-based annealers by D-Wave Systems Inc.

We convert this nondetection into limits on the total number of Galactic magnetars by computing the fraction of the young Galactic stellar population that our survey covered.

For assumed lifetimes of 104 yr, the birth rate of magnetars is between 0.003 and 0.06 yr−1.

We extract photometry for 79 old novae from the Two Micron All Sky Survey Point Source Catalog and use those data to derive the mean, un-reddened infrared colors of quiescent novae. We also extract WISE data for these objects and find that 45 of them were detected. Surprisingly, a number of these systems were detected in the WISE 22 μm band. While two of those objects produced significant dust shells (V705 Cas and V445 Pup), the others did not.

All classes of transients are posted to the World Wide Web upon detection. Our observing strategy allows sensitivity to variability over several decades in timescale. The DLS is the first survey to classify and report all types of photometric and astrometric variability detected, including solar system objects, variable stars, supernovae, and short timescale phenomena. Three unusual optical transient (OT) events were detected, flaring on 1000 s timescales. All three events were seen in the B passband, suggesting blue color indices for the phenomena. One event (OT 20020115) is determined to be from a flaring Galactic dwarf star of spectral type dM4. From the remaining two events, we find an overall rate of η = 1.4 events deg-2 day-1 on 1000 s timescales, with a 95% confidence limit of η < 4.3. One of these events (OT 20010326) originated from a compact precursor in the field of galaxy cluster A1836, and its nature is uncertain. For the second (OT 20030305) we find strong evidence for an extended extragalactic host.

From this set of targets we find a total of 5392 detections which meet the Kepler detection criteria: those criteria are periodicity of signal, an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio, and a composition test which rejects spurious detections which contain non-physical combinations of events. The detected signals are dominated by events with relatively low signal-to-noise ratio and by events with relatively short periods. The distribution of estimated transit depths appears to peak in the range between 40 and 100 parts per million, with a few detections down to fewer than 10 parts per million. The detections exhibit signal-to-noise ratios from 7.1σ, which is the lower cutoff for detections, to over 10,000σ, and periods ranging from 0.5 days, which is the lower cutoff used in the procedure, to 109 days, which is the upper limit of achievable periods given the length of the data set and the criteria used for detections. The detected signals are compared to a set of known transit events in the Kepler field of view which were derived by a different method using a longer data interval; the comparison shows that the current search correctly identified 88.1% of the known events.

The MEarth Project is an ongoing effort to do so, as a ground-based photometric survey designed to detect exoplanets as small as 2 R\n⊕ transiting mid-to-late M dwarfs within 33 pc of the Sun. Unfortunately, identifying transits of such planets in photometric monitoring is complicated both by the intrinsic stellar variability that is common among these stars and by the nocturnal cadence, atmospheric variations, and instrumental systematics that often plague Earth-bound observatories. Here, we summarize the properties of MEarth data gathered so far, emphasizing the challenges they present for transit detection. We address these challenges with a new framework to detect shallow exoplanet transits in wiggly and irregularly spaced light curves. In contrast to previous methods that clean trends from light curves before searching for transits, this framework assesses the significance of individual transits simultaneously while modeling variability, systematics, and the photometric quality of individual nights. Our Method for Including Starspots and Systematics in the Marginalized Probability of a Lone Eclipse (MISS MarPLE) uses a computationally efficient semi-Bayesian approach to explore the vast probability space spanned by the many parameters of this model, naturally incorporating the uncertainties in these parameters into its evaluation of candidate events. We show how to combine individual transits processed by MISS MarPLE into periodic transiting planet candidates and compare our results to the popular box-fitting least-squares method with simulations. By applying MISS MarPLE to observations from the MEarth Project, we demonstrate the utility of this framework for robustly assessing the false alarm probability of transit signals in real data.", "Titre": "Transit Detection in the MEarth Survey of Nearby M Dwarfs: Bridging the Clean-first, Search-later Divide", "Type": "Journal article", "LienPDF": "/article/10.1088/0004-6256/144/5/145/pdf", "doi": "10.1088/0004-6256/144/5/145"}, {"Id": 492, "Autheur": "Daniel B Poll and Zachary P Kilpatrick", "Annee": "2016", "Resume": "We analyze velocity-jump process models of persistent search for a single target on a bounded domain.

Upper limits on dipole and quadrupole amplitudes are derived under the hypothesis that any cosmic ray anisotropy is dominated by such moments in this energy range.

Deep spectroscopy of two of the candidates covering 0.64-1.02 μm with Keck-DEIMOS and all three covering 0.94-1.10 μm and 1.52-1.80 μm with Keck-NIRSPEC detects weak spectral features tentatively identified as Lyα at z = 6.95 and z = 7.69 in two of the objects.

A comparison with the spectral energy distributions of known z < 7 galaxies, including objects with strong spectral lines, large extinction, and large systematic uncertainties in the photometry, yields no objects with similar colors. However, the λ > 1 μm properties of all three objects can be matched to optically detected sources with photometric redshifts at z ~ 1.8, so the non-detection in the i\n+ and z\n+ bands is the primary factor which favors a z > 7 solution. If any of these objects are at z ~ 7, the bright end of the luminosity function is significantly higher at z > 7 than suggested by previous studies, but consistent within the statistical uncertainty and the dark matter halo distribution. If these objects are at low redshift, the Lyman break selection must be contaminated by a previously unknown population of low-redshift objects with very strong breaks in their broadband spectral energy distributions and blue NIR colors.

Because of the large sample of extrasolar planets needed to better understand planetary formation, evolution, and prevalence, this new technique represents a logical next step in instrumentation for RV extrasolar planet searches, and has been proven with the single-object Exoplanet Tracker (ET) at Kitt Peak National Observatory, and the multi-object W.

It has been suggested that the baryonic condensation of the intracluster medium (ICM) due to cooling may drag dark matter to the cores and thus steepen the profile. In this work, we search for evidence of ongoing ICM cooling in the first large, well-defined sample of SL selected galaxy clusters in the range 0.1 < z < 0.6. Based on known correlations between the ICM cooling rate and both optical emission line luminosity and star formation, we measure, for a sample of 89 SL clusters, the fraction of clusters that have [O II]λλ3727 emission in their brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). We find that the fraction of line-emitting BCGs is constant as a function of redshift for z > 0.2 and shows no statistically significant deviation from the total cluster population. Specific star formation rates, as traced by the strength of the 4000 Å break, D\n4000, are also consistent with the general cluster population. Finally, we use optical imaging of the SL clusters to measure the angular separation, R\narc, between the arc and the center of mass of each lensing cluster in our sample and test for evidence of changing [O II] emission and D\n4000 as a function of R\narc, a proxy observable for SL cross-sections. D\n4000 is constant with all values of R\narc, and the [O II] emission fractions show no dependence on R\narc for R\narc > 10'' and only very marginal evidence of increased weak [O II] emission for systems with R\narc < 10″.

Deep searches for regular satellites around Kuiper belt objects are difficult due to observational limitations, but Haumea is one of the few for which sufficient data exist. We analyze Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations, focusing on a 10-consecutive-orbit sequence obtained in 2010 July, to search for new very small satellites. To maximize the search depth, we implement and validate a nonlinear shift-and-stack method. No additional satellites of Haumea are found, but by implanting and recovering artificial sources, we characterize our sensitivity. At distances between ~10,000 and ~350,000 km from Haumea, satellites with radii as small as ~10 km are ruled out, assuming an albedo () similar to Haumea. We also rule out satellites larger than 40 km in most of the Hill sphere using other HST data. This search method rules out objects similar in size to the small moons of Pluto. By developing clear criteria for determining the number of nonlinear rates to use, we find that far fewer shift rates are required (~35) than might be expected.

When stellar-mass black holes (StMBHs) exhibit type-C low-frequency QPOs (~0.2-15 Hz), the centroid frequency of the QPO is known to correlate with the energy spectral index. The detection of such a correlation would strengthen the identification of M82 X–1's mHz QPOs as type-C and enable a more reliable mass estimate by scaling its QPO frequencies to those of type-C QPOs in StMBHs of known mass. We resolved the count rates and the hardness ratios of M82 X–1 and a nearby bright ULX (source 5/X42.3+59) through surface brightness modeling. We detected QPOs in the frequency range of 36-210 mHz during which M82 X–1's hardness ratio varied from 0.42 to 0.47. Our primary results are (1) that we do not detect any correlation between the mHz QPO frequency and the hardness ratio (a substitute for the energy spectral power-law index) and (2) similar to some accreting X-ray binaries, we find that M82 X–1's mHz QPO frequency increases with its X-ray count rate (Pearson's correlation coefficient = +0.97). The apparent lack of a correlation between the QPO centroid frequency and the hardness ratio poses a challenge to the earlier claims that the mHz QPOs of M82 X–1 are the analogs of the type-C low-frequency QPOs of StMBHs. On the other hand, it is possible that the observed relation between the hardness ratio and the QPO frequency represents the saturated portion of the correlation seen in type-C QPOs of StMBHs—in which case M82 X–1's mHz QPOs can still be analogous to type-C QPOs.", "Titre": "On the Nature of the mHz X-Ray Quasi-periodic Oscillations from Ultraluminous X-Ray Source M82 X–1: Search for Timing-Spectral Correlations", "Type": "Journal article", "LienPDF": "/article/10.1088/0004-637X/771/2/101/pdf", "doi": "10.1088/0004-637X/771/2/101"}, {"Id": 520, "Autheur": "William W Tipton and Richard G Hennig", "Annee": "2013", "Resume": "We present an evolutionary algorithm which predicts stable atomic structures and phase diagrams by searching the energy landscape of empirical and ab initio Hamiltonians.

We present 11 observations over 4.9 yr. Fitting astrometric parameters to the data reveals a residual with peak-to-peak amplitude of ~3 mas in right ascension. This residual is well fit by an acceleration term of 0.458 ± 0.032 mas yr–2. The parallax is fit to an accuracy of 0.2 mas and the proper motion terms are fit to accuracies of 0.01 mas yr–1. After fitting astrometric and acceleration terms, residuals are 0.26 mas in each coordinate, demonstrating that stellar jitter does not limit the ability to carry out radio astrometric planet detection and characterization. The acceleration term originates in part from the companion GJ 896B, but the amplitude of the acceleration in declination is not accurately predicted by the orbital model. The acceleration sets a mass upper limit of 0.15 MJ\n at a semimajor axis of 2 AU for a planetary companion to GJ 896A. For semimajor axes between 0.3 and 2 AU upper limits are determined by the maximum angular separation; the upper limits scale from the minimum value in proportion to the inverse of the radius. Upper limits at larger radii are set by the acceleration and scale as the radius squared.

A joint GW-neutrino search would enable improvements to searches by way of lower detection thresholds, larger distance range, better live-time coverage by a network of GW and neutrino detectors, and increased significance of candidate detections.

The duration of habitability for a planet located at a given distance from a star is greatly affected by the characteristics of the host star. A quantification of these effects can be used observationally in the search for life around nearby stars. The longer the duration of habitability, the more likely it is that life has evolved. The preparation of observational techniques aimed at detecting life would benefit from the scientific requirements deduced from the evolution of the habitable zone. We present a study of the evolution of the habitable zone around stars of 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 M\n☉ for metallicities ranging from Z = 0.0001 to Z = 0.070. We also consider the evolution of the habitable zone from the pre-main sequence until the asymptotic giant branch is reached. We find that metallicity strongly affects the duration of the habitable zone for a planet as well as the distance from the host star where the duration is maximized. For a 1.0 M\n☉ star with near solar metallicity, Z = 0.017, the duration of the habitable zone is >10 Gyr at distances 1.2-2.0 AU from the star, whereas the duration is >20 Gyr for high-metallicity stars (Z = 0.070) at distances of 0.7-1.8 AU, and ~4 Gyr at distances of 1.8-3.3 AU for low-metallicity stars (Z = 0.0001).

Our four seasons of radial velocities have a constant center-of-mass velocity and are consistent with the systemic velocities determined at two earlier epochs. Thus, the radial velocities also provide no support for a third component. Unfortunately, the separation domains covered by our imaging and radial velocity results do not overlap. Thus, we examined the parameters for possible orbits of a third component that could have been missed by our current observations. With our velocities we determined improved circular orbital elements for the 3.4 day double-lined binary. We also performed a spectroscopic abundance analysis of the short-period binary components and conclude that the stars are a mid- and a late-F dwarf. We find that the iron abundances of both components, [Fe/H] = 0.15, are somewhat greater than the solar value and comparable to that of stars in the Hyades. Despite the similarity of the binary components, the lithium abundances of the two stars are very unequal. The primary has log  (Li) = 2.72, while in the secondary log  (Li) ≤1.46, which corresponds to a difference of at least a factor of 18.

After one year of observation the LAT detected and identified three PWNe: the Crab Nebula, Vela-X, and the PWN inside MSH 15-52. In the meantime, the list of LAT detected pulsars increased steadily. These pulsars are characterized by high energy loss rates () from ~3 × 1033 erg s–1 to 5 × 1038 erg s–1 and are therefore likely to power a PWN. This paper summarizes the search for PWNe in the off-pulse windows of 54 LAT-detected pulsars using 16 months of survey observations. Ten sources show significant emission, seven of these likely being of magnetospheric origin. The detection of significant emission in the off-pulse interval offers new constraints on the γ-ray emitting regions in pulsar magnetospheres. The three other sources with significant emission are the Crab Nebula, Vela-X, and a new PWN candidate associated with the LAT pulsar PSR J1023–5746, coincident with the TeV source HESS J1023–575. We further explore the association between the HESS and the Fermi source by modeling its spectral energy distribution.

It has been previously used to detect faint Kuiper Belt objects using the Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based instruments, and to find a small, fast-moving asteroid during a close approach to Earth. We complement this earlier work by developing digital tracking methodology for detecting asteroids using large-format CCD imagers. We demonstrate that the technique enables the ground-based detection of large numbers of new faint asteroids. Our methodology resolves or circumvents all major obstacles to the large-scale application of digital tracking for finding main belt and near-Earth asteroids. We find that for both asteroid populations, digital tracking can deliver a factor of 10 improvement over conventional searches. Digital tracking has long been standard practice for deep Kuiper Belt surveys, but even there our methodology enables deeper integrations than have yet been attempted. Our search for main belt asteroids using a one-degree imager on the 0.9 m WIYN telescope on Kitt Peak validates our methodology, delivers sensitivity to asteroids in a regime previously probed only with 4-m and larger instruments, and leads to the detection of 156 previously unknown asteroids and 59 known objects in a single field.

This procedure takes advantage of the fact that the relative volumes available for the z ~ 8 and z ~ 9-10 selections behind lensing clusters are not greatly dependent on the details of the lensing models. We find that the normalization of the UV LF at z ~ 9 is just  that at z ~ 8, which is ~1.4× lower than extrapolating z ~ 4-8 LF results. While consistent with the evolution in the UV LF seen at z ~ 4-8, these results marginally favor a more rapid evolution at z > 8.

Inverse Compton scattering off cosmic microwave background photons of energetic electrons and positrons produced in dark matter annihilation is expected to produce significant diffuse X-ray emission. Dwarf galaxies are ideal targets for this type of dark matter search technique, being nearby, dark matter dominated systems free of any astrophysical diffuse X-ray background. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of X-ray observations of local dwarf galaxies aimed at the search for WIMP dark matter. We outline the optimal energy and angular ranges for current telescopes and analyze the systematic uncertainties connected to electron/positron diffusion. We do not observe any significant X-ray excess, and we translate this null result into limits on the mass and pair annihilation cross section for particle dark matter. Our results indicate that X-ray observations of dwarf galaxies currently constrain dark matter models at the same level as or even more strongly than gamma-ray observations of the same systems, although at the expenses of introducing additional assumptions and related uncertainties in the modeling of diffusion and energy loss processes. The limits we find constrain portions of the supersymmetric parameter space, particularly if the effect of dark matter substructures is included.

This motivates models of radiatively inefficient accretion due to either ion-electron thermal decoupling, generation of outflows that inhibit accretion, or settling of gas to a gravitationally unstable disk that forms stars in preference to feeding the black hole. The latter model predicts the presence of cold molecular gas in a thin disk around the black hole. Here we report Submillimeter Array observations of the nucleus of the giant elliptical galaxy M87 that probe 230 GHz continuum and CO (J = 2–1) line emission. Continuum emission is detected from the nucleus and several knots in the jet, including one that has been undergoing flaring behavior. We estimate a conservative upper limit on the mass of molecular gas within ~100 pc and ±400 km s−1 line-of-sight velocity of the central black hole of ~8 × 106 M☉, which includes an allowance for possible systematic errors associated with subtraction of the continuum. Ignoring such errors, we have a 3 σ sensitivity to ~3 × 106 M☉. In fact, the continuum-subtracted spectrum shows weak emission features extending up to 4 σ above the rms dispersion of the line-free channels. These may be artifacts of the continuum subtraction process. Alternatively, if they are interpreted as CO emission, then the implied molecular gas mass is ~5 × 106 M☉ spread out over a velocity range of 700 km s−1.

In 2002 August-September we acquired a total of 1077 high-resolution spectra (λ/δλ ~ 25,000) in the K-band (2 μm) wavelength region using NIRSPEC on the Keck II telescope during three transits. These data are more numerous and of better quality than the data analyzed in an initial search by Brown et al. Our analysis achieves a sensitivity sufficient to test the degree of CO absorption in the first-overtone bands during transit on the basis of plausible models of the planetary atmosphere. We analyze our observations by comparison with theoretical tangent geometry absorption spectra, computed by adding height-invariant ad hoc temperature perturbations to the model atmosphere of Sudarsky et al. and by treating cloud height as an adjustable parameter. We do not detect CO absorption. The strong 2-0 R-branch lines between 4320 and 4330 cm-1 have depths during transit less than 1.6 parts in 104 in units of the stellar continuum (3 σ limit) at a spectral resolving power of 25,000. Our analysis indicates a weakening similar to that found in the case of sodium, suggesting that a general masking mechanism is at work in the planetary atmosphere. Under the interpretation that this masking is provided by high clouds, our analysis defines the maximum cloud-top pressure (i.e., minimum height) as a function of the model atmospheric temperature. For the relatively hot model used by Charbonneau et al. to interpret their sodium detection, our CO limit requires cloud tops at or above 3.3 mbar, and these clouds must be opaque at a wavelength of 2 μm. High clouds comprised of submicron-sized particles are already present in some models but may not provide sufficient opacity to account for our CO result. Cooler model atmospheres, having smaller atmospheric scale heights and lower CO mixing ratios, may alleviate this problem to some extent. However, even models 500 K cooler than the Sudarsky et al. model require clouds above the 100 mbar level to be consistent with our observations.

The relative beaming factor brel, i.e., the ratio of all afterglow rates including orphans to those associated with observable prompt GRBs, could be as high as brel  100 for searches deeper than R ~ 24, depending on afterglow parameters.

DES-SN is a search for transients in which ten 3 deg2 fields are repeatedly observed in the g, r, i, z passbands with a cadence of about 1 week. The observing strategy has been optimized to measure high-quality light curves and redshifts for thousands of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) with the goal of measuring dark energy parameters. The essential DiffImg functions are to align each search image to a deep reference image, do a pixel-by-pixel subtraction, and then examine the subtracted image for significant positive detections of point-source objects. The vast majority of detections are subtraction artifacts, but after selection requirements and image filtering with an automated scanning program, there are ~130 detections per deg2 per observation in each band, of which only ~25% are artifacts. Of the ~7500 transients discovered by DES-SN in its first observing season, each requiring a detection on at least two separate nights, Monte Carlo (MC) simulations predict that 27% are expected to be SNe Ia or core-collapse SNe. Another ~30% of the transients are artifacts in which a small number of observations satisfy the selection criteria for a single-epoch detection. Spectroscopic analysis shows that most of the remaining transients are AGNs and variable stars. Fake SNe Ia are overlaid onto the images to rigorously evaluate detection efficiencies and to understand the DiffImg performance. The DiffImg efficiency measured with fake SNe agrees well with expectations from a MC simulation that uses analytical calculations of the fluxes and their uncertainties. In our 8 \"shallow\" fields with single-epoch 50% completeness depth ~23.5, the SN Ia efficiency falls to 1/2 at redshift z ≈ 0.7; in our 2 \"deep\" fields with mag-depth ~24.5, the efficiency falls to 1/2 at z ≈ 1.1. A remaining performance issue is that the measured fluxes have additional scatter (beyond Poisson fluctuations) that increases with the host galaxy surface brightness at the transient location.

As part of our ongoing project to measure the occurrence rate of extrasolar moons, in this work we present results from a survey focusing on eight Kepler planetary candidates associated with M dwarfs. Using photodynamical modeling and Bayesian multimodal nested sampling, we find no compelling evidence for an exomoon in these eight systems. Upper limits on the presence of such bodies probe down to masses of ~0.4 M\n⊕ in the best case. For KOI-314, we are able to confirm the planetary nature of two out of the three known transiting candidates using transit timing variations. Of particular interest is KOI-314c, which is found to have a mass of  M\n⊕, making it the lowest mass transiting planet discovered to date. With a radius of  R\n⊕, this Earth-mass world is likely enveloped by a significant gaseous envelope comprising % of the planet by radius. We also find evidence to support the planetary nature of KOI-784 via transit timing, but we advocate further observations to verify the signals. In both systems, we infer that the inner planet has a higher density than the outer world, which may be indicative of photo-evaporation.

The survey resolved two brown dwarf binaries: the L dwarf system Kelu-1 AB and the newly discovered L/T transition system 2MASS 031059+164815 AB. For both systems, common proper motion has already been confirmed in follow-up observations which have been published elsewhere. The derived separations of the binaries are smaller than 6 AU and consistent with previous brown dwarf binary statistics. Their mass ratios of q ≥ 0.8 confirm the preference for equal-mass systems similar to a large number of other surveys. Furthermore, we found tentative evidence for a companion to the L4 dwarf 2MASSW 033703–175807, straddling the brown dwarf/planetary mass boundary and revealing an uncommonly low-mass ratio system (q ≈ 0.2) compared to the vast majority of previously found brown dwarf binaries. With a derived minimum mass of 10-15 M\nJup a planetary nature of the secondary cannot be ruled out yet. However, it seems more likely to be a very low mass brown dwarf secondary at the border of the spectral T/Y transition regime, primarily due to its similarities to recently found very cool T dwarfs.

In the I band the ratio is about 400. The advantages of a closer habitable zone and smaller stars (together with the numerical superiority of M stars) more than compensate for the reduced signal because of the lower luminosity of the later-type stars. That is, M stars can yield reliable transit detections at much fainter apparent magnitudes than G stars. However, to achieve this greater sensitivity, the later-type stars must be monitored to these correspondingly fainter magnitudes, which can engender several practical problems. We show that with modest modifications, the Kepler mission could extend its effective sensitivity from its current MV = 6 to 9. This would not capture the whole M dwarf peak but would roughly triple its sensitivity to Earth-like planets in the habitable zone. To take advantage of the huge bump in the sensitivity function at MV = 12 would require major changes in Kepler. However, the reduced photometric-precision requirements at MV = 12 makes a search for these transits possible from the ground. Photometric stability requirements are much less severe for M stars than G stars.

First, we fully integrate the spherical zone constraint into the estimation procedure of ambiguity resolution, but not in the validation procedure.

This scheme also improves the precision of the float ambiguity solution, thus avoiding the problem of search halting.

However, CO white dwarfs are born with masses much below the Chandrasekhar limit and thus require mass accretion to become Type Ia supernovae. There are two main scenarios for accretion: first, the merger of two white dwarfs and, second, a stable mass accretion from a companion star.

Our survey detected 62 sources with 95 GHz methanol masers above a 3σ detection limit, which includes 47 high-mass sources and 15 low-mass sources. Therefore, the detection rate is 38% for high-mass outflow sources and 9% for low-mass outflow sources, suggesting that class I methanol masers are relatively easily excited in high-mass sources. There are 37 newly detected 95 GHz methanol masers (including 27 high-mass and 10 low-mass sources), 19 of which are newly identified (i.e., first identification) class I methanol masers (including 13 high-mass and 6 low-mass sources). A statistical analysis of the distributions of maser detections with the outflow parameters reveals that the maser detection efficiency increases with the outflow properties (e.g., mass, momentum, kinetic energy, mechanical luminosity of outflows, etc.). Systematic investigations of the relationships between the intrinsic luminosity of methanol masers and the outflow properties (including mass, momentum, kinetic energy, bolometric luminosity, and mass-loss rate of the central stellar sources) indicate a positive correlation.

The temporal coincidence of any prompt EM counterpart with a gravitationally timed merger may offer the best chance of identifying a unique host galaxy. We discuss the challenges posed by searches for such prompt EM counterparts and propose novel observational strategies to address them. In particular, we discuss the size and shape evolution of the LISA localization error ellipses on the sky and quantify the corresponding requirements for dedicated EM surveys of the area prior to coalescence. A triggered EM counterpart search campaign will require monitoring a several square degree area. It could aim for variability at the 24-27 mag level in optical bands, for example, which corresponds to 1%-10% of the Eddington luminosity of the prime LISA sources of ~106-107 M☉ BHs at z = 1–2, on timescales of minutes to hours, the orbital timescale of the binary in the last 2-4 weeks of coalescence. A cross-correlation of the period of any variable EM signal with the quasi-periodic gravitational waveform over 10-1000 cycles may aid the detection. Alternatively, EM searches can detect a transient signal accompanying the coalescence. The triggered searches will be ambitious, but if they successfully identify a unique prompt EM counterpart, they will enable new fundamental tests of gravitational physics.

Using data collected from 1997 April to October (130.1 days of live time), a general survey of the northern hemisphere revealed no statistically significant excess of events from any direction. The sensitivity for a flux of muon neutrinos is based on the effective detection area for through-going muons. Averaged over the northern sky, the effective detection area exceeds 10,000 m2 for Eμ ≈ 10 TeV. Neutrinos generated in the atmosphere by cosmic-ray interactions were used to verify the predicted performance of the detector.

Within the wavelength band covered by the RSR, 20 spectral lines from 14 different atomic and molecular species were detected. Based on simultaneous fits to the spectrum of each galaxy, a number of key molecular line ratios are derived. A simple model which assumes the emission arises from an ensemble of Milky Way like Giant Molecular Cloud cores can adequately fit the observed line ratios using molecular abundances based on Galactic molecular cloud cores. Variations seen in some line ratios, such as 13CO/HCN and HCO+/HCN, can be explained if the mean density of the molecular gas varies from galaxy to galaxy. However, NGC 3690, NGC 4258, and NGC 6240 show very large HCO+/HCN ratios and require significant abundance enhancement of HCO+ over HCN, possible due to the proximity to active galactic nucleus activity.

Recently, it was shown that the radiation-mediated and radiation-dominated shock in an optically thick wind must transform into a collisionless shock and can produce hard X-rays. The X-rays are expected to peak at late times, relative to maximum visible light. Here we report on a search, using Swift/XRT and Chandra, for X-ray emission from 28 SNe that belong to classes whose progenitors are suspected to be embedded in dense CSM. Our sample includes 19 Type IIn SNe, one Type Ibn SN, and eight hydrogen-poor superluminous SNe (SLSN-I such as SN 2005ap). Two SNe (SN 2006jc and SN 2010jl) have X-ray properties that are roughly consistent with the expectation for X-rays from a collisionless shock in optically thick CSM. However, the X-ray emission from SN 2006jc can also be explained as originating in an optically thin region. Thus, we propose that the optical light curve of SN 2010jl is powered by shock breakout in CSM. We suggest that two other events (SN 2010al and SN 2011ht) were too X-ray bright during the SN maximum optical light to be explained by the shock-breakout model. We conclude that the light curves of some, but not all, SNe IIn/Ibn are powered by shock breakout in CSM. For the rest of the SNe in our sample, including all of the SLSN-I events, our X-ray limits are not deep enough and were typically obtained too early (i.e., near the SN maximum light) for definitive conclusions about their nature. Late-time X-ray observations are required in order to further test whether these SNe are indeed embedded in dense CSM. We review the conditions required for a shock breakout in a wind profile. We argue that the timescale, relative to maximum light, for the SN to peak in X-rays is a probe of the column density and the density profile above the shock region. In SNe whose X-ray emission slowly rises, and peaks at late times, the optical light curve is likely powered by the diffusion of shock energy in a dense CSM. We note that if the CSM density profile falls faster than a constant-rate wind-density profile, then X-rays may escape at earlier times than estimated for the wind-profile case. Furthermore, if the CSM has a region in which the density profile is very steep relative to a steady wind-density profile, or if the CSM is neutral, then the radio free-free absorption may be sufficiently low for radio emission to be detected.", "Titre": "X-Ray Emission from Supernovae in Dense Circumstellar Matter Environments: A Search for Collisionless Shocks", "Type": "Journal article", "LienPDF": "/article/10.1088/0004-637X/763/1/42/pdf", "doi": "10.1088/0004-637X/763/1/42"}, {"Id": 616, "Autheur": "John J.

By leveraging the >10-year baselines for objects with repeat spectroscopy, we uncover two new changing-look quasars and a third discovered previously. Decomposition of the multiepoch spectra and analysis of the broad emission lines suggest that the quasar accretion disk emission dims because of rapidly decreasing accretion rates (by factors of 2.5), while disfavoring changes in intrinsic dust extinction for the two objects where these analyses are possible. Broad emission line energetics also support intrinsic dimming of quasar emission as the origin for this phenomenon rather than transient tidal disruption events or supernovae.

As a test of this prediction, we have carried out a search for variability in Type 2 quasars in SDSS Stripe 82 using difference-imaging photometry. Starting with the Type 2 AGN catalogs of Zakamska et al. and Reyes et al., we find evidence of significant g-band variability in 17 out of 173 objects for which light curves could be measured from the Stripe 82 data. To determine the nature of this variability, we obtained new Keck spectropolarimetry observations for seven of these variable AGNs. The Keck data show that these objects have low continuum polarizations (p  1% in most cases) and all seven have broad Hα and/or Mg II emission lines in their total (unpolarized) spectra, indicating that they should actually be classified as Type 1 AGNs. We conclude that the primary reason variability is found in the SDSS-selected Type 2 AGN samples is that these samples contain a small fraction of Type 1 AGNs as contaminants, and it is not necessary to invoke more exotic possible explanations such as a population of \"naked\" or unobscured Type 2 quasars.

Although Kepler has discovered hundreds of transiting super-Earth candidates over the past 4 yr, the majority of these planets orbit stars that are too far away and too faint to allow for detailed atmospheric characterization and reliable mass estimates. Ground-based transit surveys focus on much brighter stars, but most lack the sensitivity to detect planets in this size range.

In this paper, we present a novel artificial intelligence (AI) program that identifies pulsars from recent surveys by using image pattern recognition with deep neural nets—the PICS  (Pulsar Image-based Classification System) AI. The AI mimics human experts and distinguishes pulsars from noise and interference by looking for patterns from candidate plots. Different from other pulsar selection programs that search for expected patterns, the PICS AI is taught the salient features of different pulsars from a set of human-labeled candidates through machine learning. The training candidates are collected from the Pulsar Arecibo L-band Feed Array (PALFA) survey. The information from each pulsar candidate is synthesized in four diagnostic plots, which consist of image data with up to thousands of pixels. The AI takes these data from each candidate as its input and uses thousands of such candidates to train its ~9000 neurons. The deep neural networks in this AI system grant it superior ability to recognize various types of pulsars as well as their harmonic signals. The trained AI's performance has been validated with a large set of candidates from a different pulsar survey, the Green Bank North Celestial Cap survey. In this completely independent test, the PICS ranked 264 out of 277 pulsar-related candidates, including all 56 previously known pulsars and 208 of their harmonics, in the top 961 (1%) of 90,008 test candidates, missing only 13 harmonics. The first non-pulsar candidate appears at rank 187, following 45 pulsars and 141 harmonics. In other words, 100% of the pulsars were ranked in the top 1% of all candidates, while 80% were ranked higher than any noise or interference. The performance of this system can be improved over time as more training data are accumulated.

Using this technique, 20 young stars in the β Pic (age ~ 12 Myr) and TW Hya (age ~ 8 Myr) Associations were monitored over several years to search for low-mass companions; we also included the chromospherically active field star GJ 873 (EV Lac) in this survey. Based on comparisons with previous optical observations of these young active stars, RV measurements at infrared wavelengths mitigate the RV noise caused by star spots by a factor of ~3. Nevertheless, star spot noise is still the dominant source of measurement error for young stars at 2.3 μm, and limits the precision to ~77 m s–1 for the slowest rotating stars (v sin i < 6 km s–1), increasing to ~168 m s–1 for rapidly rotating stars (v sin i > 12 km s–1).

The X-ray point sources in these supernova remnants are excellent targets for probing the existence of supernova fallback disks, since irradiation of a disk by a central X-ray source should lead to an infrared excess. We used ground-based optical and near-infrared imaging and Spitzer Space Telescope mid-infrared imaging to search for optical/infrared counterparts at the X-ray point-source positions measured by the Chandra X-Ray Observatory. We did not detect any counterparts and hence find no evidence for fallback disks around any of these sources. In PKS 1209-52 we are able to exclude a nearby optical/infrared candidate counterpart. In RCW 103, a blend of three faint stars at the X-ray source position prevents us from deriving useful limits. For the other targets, the upper limits on the infrared/X-ray flux ratio are as deep as (1.0-1.7) × 10-4. Comparing these limits to the ratio of ≈6 × 10-5 measured for 4U 0142+61 (a young pulsar recently found with an X-ray-irradiated dust disk), we conclude that the nondetection of any disks around young neutron stars studied here is consistent with their relatively low X-ray luminosities, although we note that a similar dust disk around the neutron star in Pup A should be detectable by deeper infrared observations.", "Titre": "A Search for Fallback Disks in Four Young Supernova Remnants", "Type": "Journal article", "LienPDF": "/article/10.1086/509869/pdf", "doi": "10.1086/509869"}, {"Id": 627, "Autheur": "Kevin Gullikson, Michael Endl, William D.

We find that most afterglows are consistent with pure power laws plus extinction. Significant outliers to the population exist at the 5%-10% level and have anomalously soft, possibly thermal spectra. Four bursts are singled out via possible detections of two to five lines: GRB 060218, GRB 060202, GRB 050822, and GRB 050714B. Alternatively, a blackbody model with kT ~ 0.1-0.5 keV can describe the soft emission in each afterglow. The most significant soft-component detections in the full data set of ~2000 spectra correspond to GRB 060218/SN 2006aj, with line significances ranging up to ~20 σ. A thermal plasma model fit to the data indicates that the flux is primarily due to L-shell transitions of Fe at roughly solar abundance. We associate (>4 σ significant) line triggers in the three other events with K-shell transitions in light metals. We favor a model where the possible line emission in these afterglows arises from the mildly relativistic cocoon of matter surrounding the GRB jet as it penetrates and exits the surface of the progenitor star. The emitting material in each burst is at a similar distance ~1012-1013 cm, a similar density ~1017 cm-3, and subject to a similar flux of ionizing radiation. The lines may correlate with the X-ray flaring. For the blackbody interpretation, the soft flux may arise from breakout of the GRB shock or plasma cocoon from the progenitor stellar wind, as recently suggested for GRB 060218 (Campana et al. 2006). Due to the low z of GRB 060218, bursts faint in gamma rays with fluxes dominated by this soft X-ray component could outnumber classical GRBs 100 to 1.", "Titre": "On the Early-Time X-Ray Spectra of Swift Afterglows.

We test this hypothesis by searching the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (UDF) F606W image for low surface brightness features of angular sizes, ranging between θDLA = 025 (dDLA = 2 kpc) and 40 (dDLA = 31 kpc).

Our search yields upper limits on the comoving SFR densities that are between factors of 30 and 100 lower than predictions, suggesting a reduction by more than a factor of 10 in star formation efficiency at z ~ 3. The lower star formation efficiencies may be due to the reduced molecular content of the DLA gas. We also find that the cosmological increase with redshift of the critical surface density for the Toomre instability may be sufficient to suppress star formation to the levels implied by the UDF observations. The upper limits on in situ star formation reduce the predicted metallicities at z ~ 3 to be significantly lower than observed, and reduce the heat input in the gas to be substantially lower than the inferred cooling rates. In contrast, the radiative output from compact Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) with R < 27 is sufficient to balance the comoving cooling rate.

This is consistent with a scenario in which these galaxies have low metallicity, causing an increased CO-to-H2 conversion factor, i.e., weaker CO-emission for a given molecular (H2) mass.

Assuming that a fraction of distant (60 < d\nhelio < 100 kpc) Galactic halo RR Lyrae stars are members of yet to be discovered low-luminosity dSph galaxies, we perform a guided search for these low-luminosity dSph galaxies. In order to detect the presence of dSph galaxies, we combine stars selected from more than 123 sightlines centered on RR Lyrae stars identified by the Palomar Transient Factory. We find that this method is sensitive enough to detect the presence of Segue 1-like galaxies (, rh\n = 30 pc) even if only ~20 sightlines were occupied by such dSph galaxies. Yet, when our method is applied to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 10 imaging catalog, no signal is detected. An application of our method to sightlines occupied by pairs of close (<200 pc) horizontal branch stars, also did not yield a detection. Thus, we place upper limits on the number of low-luminosity dSph galaxies with half-light radii from 30 pc to 120 pc, and in the probed volume of the halo. Stronger constraints on the luminosity function may be obtained by applying our method to sightlines centered on RR Lyrae stars selected from the Pan-STARRS1 survey, and eventually, from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.

They thereby challenge the conventional LGRB-SN connection and naturally give rise to the question: are there other peculiar features in their afterglows which would help shed light on their progenitors? To answer this question, we combine new observational data with published data and investigate the multiband temporal and spectral properties of the two afterglows. We find that both afterglows can be well interpreted within the framework of the jetted standard external shock wave model, and that the afterglow parameters for both bursts fall well within the range observed for other LGRBs. Hence, from the properties of the afterglows there is nothing to suggest that these bursts should have another progenitor than other LGRBs. Recently, Swift-discovered GRB 080503 also has the spike + tail structure during its prompt γ-ray emission seemingly similar to GRB 060614. We analyze the prompt emission of this burst and find that this GRB is actually a hard-spike + hard-tail burst with a spectral lag of 0.8 ± 0.4 s during its tail emission. Thus, the properties of the prompt emission of GRB 060614 and GRB 080503 are clearly different, motivating further thinking of GRB classification (and even identification of faint core-collapse SNe). Finally, we note that, whereas the progenitor of the two SN-less bursts remains uncertain, the core-collapse origin for the SN-less bursts would be quite certain if a windlike environment can be observationally established, e.g., from an optical decay faster than the X-ray decay in the afterglow's slow cooling phase.", "Titre": "In Search of Progenitors for Supernovaless Gamma-Ray Bursts 060505 and 060614: Re-examination of Their Afterglows", "Type": "Journal article", "LienPDF": "/article/10.1088/0004-637X/696/1/971/pdf", "doi": "10.1088/0004-637X/696/1/971"}, {"Id": 643, "Autheur": "George Wallerstein", "Annee": "1968", "Resume": "", "Titre": "A Search for Rapid Light Variations in Wolf-Rayet Stars", "Type": "Journal article", "LienPDF": "/article/10.1086/128667/pdf", "doi": "10.1086/128667"}, {"Id": 644, "Autheur": "George H.

These data encompass 150 known members of IC 348, including 14 primaries that are likely to be substellar (M1 = 0.015-0.08 M☉). The detection limits for companions to low-mass stars and brown dwarfs in the PC images are Δm791 = 0, 2.5, and 5.5 at separations of 005, 01, and 03, respectively, which correspond to M2/M1 = 1, 0.3, and 0.1 at 15, 30, and 90 AU. Meanwhile, for heavily saturated solar-mass primaries in the WFC images, the limits are Δm791 = 0 and 6 (M2/M1 = 1 and 0.04) at 02 and 04. The sky limiting magnitude of m791 ~ 26 at large separations from a primary corresponds to a mass of ~0.006 M☉ according to the evolutionary models of Chabrier and Baraffe. Point sources appearing near known and candidate cluster members are classified as either field stars or likely cluster members through their positions on the color-magnitude diagram constructed from the WFPC2 photometry. For the two faintest candidate companions appearing in these data, we have obtained 0.8-2.5 μm spectra with SpeX at the IRTF. Through a comparison to spectra of optically classified dwarfs, giants, and pre-main-sequence objects, we classify these two sources as cluster members with spectral types near M6, corresponding to masses of ~0.1 M☉ with the models of Chabrier and Baraffe. Thus, no probable substellar companions are detected in this survey. After considering all potential binaries within our WFPC2 images, we find that the frequencies of stellar and substellar companions within 04-5'' (120-1600 AU) from low-mass stars (M1 = 0.08-0.5) in IC 348 agree within the uncertainties with measurements in the field. The factor of ~3-10 deficiency in brown dwarfs relative to stars among companions at wide separations in IC 348 and across the much larger range of separations probed for field stars in previous work is equal within the uncertainties to the deficiency in brown dwarfs in measurements of mass functions of isolated objects. In other words, when defined relative to stars, the brown dwarf \"desert\" among companions is also present among isolated objects, which is expected if stellar and substellar companions form in the same manner as their free-floating counterparts. Meanwhile, among the 14 substellar primaries in our survey of IC 348, no companions are detected.

With semiamplitudes of 10.6-19 m s-1, these planets induce Doppler amplitudes similar to those of Jupiter analogs, albeit with shorter periods. Many of the most interesting future Doppler planets will be detected at these semiamplitude levels, placing a premium on measurement precision. The detection of such amplitudes in data extending back 6 yr gives confidence in the Anglo-Australian Planet Search's ability to detect Jupiter analogs as our time baseline extends to 12 yr. We discuss the criticality of such detections for the design of the next generation of extremely large telescopes and also highlight prospects for suitable observing strategies to push to below 1 m s-1 precisions for bright stars in a search for sub-Neptunian planets.", "Titre": "Three Low-Mass Planets from the Anglo-Australian Planet Search", "Type": "Journal article", "LienPDF": "/article/10.1086/428661/pdf", "doi": "10.1086/428661"}, {"Id": 656, "Autheur": "J.

Sometimes, however, the optical event could be significantly less luminous than a supernova and a direct collapse to a black hole, where the star just disappears, is possible. The GW event GW150914 was detected by the LIGO Virgo Collaboration via a burst analysis that gave localization contours enclosing the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Shortly thereafter, we used DECam to observe 102 deg2 of the localization area, including 38 deg2 on the LMC for a missing supergiant search. We construct a complete catalog of LMC luminous red supergiants, the best candidates to undergo invisible core collapse, and collected catalogs of other candidates: less luminous red supergiants, yellow supergiants, blue supergiants, luminous blue variable stars, and Wolf–Rayet stars. Of the objects in the imaging region, all are recovered in the images. The timescale for stellar disappearance is set by the free-fall time, which is a function of the stellar radius. Our observations at 4 and 13 days after the event result in a search sensitive to objects of up to about 200 solar radii. We conclude that it is unlikely that GW150914 was caused by the core collapse of a relatively compact supergiant in the LMC, consistent with the LIGO Collaboration analyses of the gravitational waveform as best interpreted as a high mass binary black hole merger.

It is based on calculating the Q factor, a measure of flux-normalized Doppler sensitivity in the fringing spectra created with DFDI. We calculate the Q factor as a function of spectral resolution R, stellar-projected rotational velocity Vsin i, stellar effective temperature T\neff, and optical path difference (OPD) of the interferometer. We also compare the DFDI Q factor to that for the popular cross-dispersed echelle spectrograph method (the direct echelle (DE) method). We find that (1) Q\nDFDI is a factor of 1.5-3 higher than Q\nDE at R ranging from 5000 to 20,000; (2) Q\nDFDI and Q\nDE converge at a very high R (R ≥ 100,000); (3) Q\nDFDI increases as R increases and Vsin i deceases; (4) for a given R, Q\nDFDI increases as T\neff drops from 3100 K to 2400 K (M4V to M9V). We also investigate how Q\nDFDI is affected by OPD and find that a 5 mm deviation from the optimal OPD does not significantly affect Q\nDFDI (10% or less) for a wide range of R. Given that the NIR Doppler measurement is likely to be detector-limited for a while, we introduce new merit functions, which is directly related to photon-limited radial velocity (RV) uncertainty, to evaluate Doppler performance with the DFDI and DE methods. We find that DFDI has strength in wavelength coverage and multi-object capability over the DE for a limited detector resource. We simulate the performance of the InfraRed Exoplanet Tracker (IRET) based on the DFDI design, being considered for the next generation IR Doppler measurements. The predicted photon-limited RV uncertainty suggests that IRET is capable of detecting Earth-like exoplanets in habitable zone around nearby bright M dwarfs if they exist. A new method is developed to quantitatively estimate the influence of telluric lines on RV uncertainty. Our study shows that photon-limited RV uncertainty can be reached if 99% of the strength of telluric lines can be removed from the measured stellar spectra. At low to moderate levels of telluric line strength removal (50%-90%), the optimal RV uncertainty is typically a factor of two to three times larger than photon-limited RV uncertainty.", "Titre": "Fundamental Performance of a Dispersed Fixed Delay Interferometer in Searching for Planets around M Dwarfs", "Type": "Journal article", "LienPDF": "/article/10.1088/0004-637X/738/2/132/pdf", "doi": "10.1088/0004-637X/738/2/132"}, {"Id": 659, "Autheur": "C Pankow, S Klimenko, G Mitselmakher, I Yakushin, G Vedovato, M Drago, R A Mercer and P Ajith", "Annee": "2009", "Resume": "Compact binary coalescence (CBC) is one of the most promising sources of gravitational waves.

This star was selected as a potential target in the course of our ongoing survey to search for pulsators of the EC 14026 type. Our model atmosphere analysis of the time-averaged Multiple Mirror Telescope (MMT) optical spectrum of PG 0014+067 indicates that this star has Teff = 33,550 ± 380 K and log g = 5.77 ± 0.10, which places it right in the middle of the theoretical EC 14026 instability region in the log g-Teff plane. A standard analysis of our Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) light curve reveals the presence of at least 13 distinct harmonic oscillations with periods in the range 80-170 s. Fine structure (closely spaced frequency doublets) is observed in three of these oscillations, and five high-frequency peaks due to nonlinear cross frequency superpositions of the basic oscillations are also possibly seen in the Fourier spectrum. The largest oscillation has an amplitude 0.22% of the mean brightness of the star, making PG 0014+067 the EC 14026 star with the smallest intrinsic amplitudes so far. On the basis of the 13 observed periods, we carry out a detailed asteroseismological analysis of the data starting with an extensive search in parameter space for a model that could account for the observations. To make this search efficient, objective, and reliable, we use a newly developed period matching technique based on an optimization algorithm. This search leads to a model that can account remarkably well for the 13 observed periods in the light curve of PG 0014+067. A detailed comparison of the theoretical period spectrum of this optimal model with the distribution of the 13 observed periods leads to the realization that 10 other pulsations, with lower amplitudes than the threshold value used in our standard analysis, are probably present in the light curve of PG 0014+067. Altogether, we tentatively identify 23 distinct pulsation modes in our target star (counting the frequency doublets referred to above as single modes). These are all low-order acoustic modes with adjacent values of k and with l = 0, 1, 2, and 3. They define a band of unstable periods, in close agreement with nonadiabatic pulsation theory. Furthermore, the average relative dispersion between the 23 observed periods and the periods of the corresponding 23 theoretical modes of the optimal model is only 0.8%, a remarkable achievement by asteroseismological standards. On the basis of our analysis, we infer that the global structural parameters of PG 0014+067 are log g = 5.780 ± 0.008, Teff = 34,500K ± 2690 K, M*/M☉ = 0.490 ± 0.019, log(Menv/M*) = -4.31 ± 0.22, and R/R☉ = 0.149 ± 0.004. If we combine these estimates of the surface gravity, total mass, and radius with our value of the spectroscopic temperature (which is more accurately evaluated than its asteroseismological counterpart, in direct contrast to the surface gravity), we also find that PG 0014+067 has a luminosity L/L☉ = 25.5 ± 2.5, has an absolute visual magnitude MV = 4.48 ± 0.12, and is located at a distance d = 1925 ± 195 pc (using V = 15.9 ± 0.1).

The lack of detectable pulses represents a big open problem for two important reasons. The first is that the structure of the accretion flow in the region closest to the neutron star is not well understood and it is therefore unclear what is the mechanism that prevents the pulse formation. The second is that the detection of pulsations would immediately reveal the spin of the neutron star. AQUILA X–1 is a special source among low mass X-ray binaries because it has showed the unique property of pulsating for only ~150 s out of a total observing time of more than 1.5 million seconds. However, the existing upper limits on the pulsed fraction leave open two alternatives. Either AQUILA X–1 has very weak pulses which have been undetected, or it has genuinely pulsed only for a tiny amount of the observed time. Understanding which of the two scenarios is the correct one is fundamental to increase our knowledge about the pulse formation process and understand the chances we have to detect weak pulses in other low-mass X-ray binaries. In this paper we perform a semi-coherent search on the entire X-ray data available for AQUILA X–1.

Recently, it has been proposed that observations of variability in scattered light (both polarized and total flux) from such terrestrial-sized exoplanets could be used to determine if they possess large surface oceans, an important indicator of potential habitability. Observing such oceans at visible wavelengths would be difficult, however, in part because of obscuration by atmospheric scattering. Here, we investigate whether observations performed in the near-infrared (NIR), where Rayleigh scattering is reduced, could improve the detectability of exoplanet oceans. We model two wavebands of the NIR which are \"window regions\" for an Earth-like atmosphere: 1.55-1.75 μm and 2.1-2.3 μm. Our model confirms that obscuration in these bands from Rayleigh scattering is very low, but aerosols are generally the limiting factor throughout the wavelength range for Earth-like atmospheres. As a result, observations at NIR wavelengths are significantly better at detecting oceans than those at visible wavelengths only when aerosols are very thin by Earth standards. Clouds further dilute the ocean reflection signature. Hence, other techniques, e.g., time-resolved color photometry, may be more effective in the search for liquid water on exoplanet surfaces.

It was recently noted that there are apparent differences in the properties of radio-quiet and radio-loud subsets. In particular, the average observed radio-loud pulsar is younger than the average radio-quiet one and is located at lower Galactic latitude. Even so, the analysis based on the full list of pulsars may suffer from selection effects. Namely, most radio-loud pulsars are first discovered in the radio band, while radio-quiet ones are found using the gamma-ray data. In this work we perform a blind search for gamma-ray pulsars using the Fermi-LAT data alone, using all point sources from the 3FGL catalog as the candidates. Unlike our previous work, the present catalog is constructed with a semi-coherent method based on the time-differencing technique and covers the full range of characteristic ages down to 1 kyr. The search resulted in a catalog of 40 non-recycled pulsars, 25 of which are radio-quiet. All pulsars found in the search were previously known gamma-ray pulsars. We find no statistically significant differences in age or in distributions in Galactic latitude for the radio-loud and radio-quiet pulsars, while the distributions in rotation period are marginally different with a statistical probability of . The fraction of radio-quiet pulsars is estimated as .

Astrometric parameters are commonly derived by fitting them as parameters of a timing model to a series of pulse times of arrival (TOAs). TOAs measured to microsecond precision over spans of several years can yield position measurements with sub-milliarcsecond precision. However, timing-based astrometry can become biased if a pulsar displays any red spin noise or a red signal produced by the stochastic gravitational wave background. We investigate how noise of different spectral types is absorbed by timing models, leading to significant estimation biases in the astrometric parameters. We find that commonly used techniques for fitting timing models in the presence of red noise (Cholesky whitening) prevent the absorption of noise into the timing model remarkably well if the time baseline of observations exceeds several years, but are inadequate for dealing with shorter pulsar data sets. Independent of timing, pulsar-optimized very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) is capable of providing position estimates precise to the sub-milliarcsecond levels needed for high-precision timing. In order to make VLBI astrometric parameters useful in pulsar timing models, the transformation between the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF) and the dynamical solar system ephemeris used for pulsar timing must be constrained to within a few microarcseconds. We compute a transformation between the ICRF and pulsar timing frames and quantitatively discuss how the transformation will improve in coming years. We find that incorporating VLBI astrometry into the timing models of pulsars for which only a couple of years of timing data exist will lead to more realistic assessments of red spin noise and could enhance the amplitude of gravitational wave signatures in post-fit timing residuals by factors of 20 or more.", "Titre": "The Benefits of VLBI Astrometry to Pulsar Timing Array Searches for Gravitational Radiation", "Type": "Journal article", "LienPDF": "/article/10.1088/0004-637X/777/2/104/pdf", "doi": "10.1088/0004-637X/777/2/104"}, {"Id": 692, "Autheur": "Robert A.

Regular satellites orbit all the giant planets in our solar system, suggesting that their formation is a natural by-product of the planet formation process. There is no reason for exomoon formation not to be similarly likely in exoplanetary systems. Moreover, our current understanding of that formation process does not preclude satellite formation in systems where gas giants undergo migration from their formation locations into the terrestrial planet habitable zone. Indeed, regular satellite formation and Type II migration are both linked to the clearing of a gap in the protoplanetary disk by a planet, and so may be inextricably linked. Migration would also multiply the chances of capturing both irregular satellites and Trojan companions sufficiently massive to be habitable. The habitability of such exomoons and exo-Trojans will critically depend on their mass, whether or not they host a magnetosphere, and (for the exomoon case) their orbital radius around the host exoplanet.", "Titre": "The Anglo-Australian Planet Search.

This result is consistent with microlensing results, assuming a popular halo model.\nHowever, using new stellar models and parallax observations of low-mass, low-metallicity stars, we obtain much tighter bounds on low-mass stars.

Our search method identifies HISA as spatially and spectrally confined dark H I features that appear as negative residuals after removing larger scale emission components with a modified CLEAN algorithm. Adjacent HISA volume-pixels (voxels) are grouped into features in (l,b,v) space, and the H I brightness of voxels outside the three-dimensional feature boundaries is smoothly interpolated to estimate the absorption amplitude and the unabsorbed H I emission brightness. The reliability and completeness of our HISA detection scheme have been tested extensively with model data. We detect most features over a wide range of sizes, line widths, amplitudes, and background levels, with poor detection only where the absorption brightness temperature amplitude is weak, the absorption scale approaches that of the correlated noise, or the background level is too faint for HISA to be distinguished reliably from emission gaps. False detection rates are very low in all parts of the parameter space except at sizes and amplitudes approaching those of noise fluctuations.

The demand for novel hard magnetic phases with more widely available RE metals, reduced RE content or, even better, completely free of RE metals is therefore tremendous. The chances are that such materials still exist given the large number of as yet unexplored alloy systems. To discover such phases, an elaborate concept is necessary which can restrict and prioritize the search field while making use of efficient synthesis and analysis methods. It is shown that an efficient synthesis of new phases using heterogeneous non-equilibrium diffusion couples and reaction sintering is possible. Quantitative microstructure analysis of the domain pattern of the hard magnetic phases can be used to estimate the intrinsic magnetic parameters (saturation polarization from the domain contrast, anisotropy constant from the domain width, Curie temperature from the temperature dependence of the domain contrast). The probability of detecting TM-rich phases for a given system is high, therefore the approach enables one to scan through even higher component systems with one single sample.

This sample includes all nine X-ray afterglows with published claims of line detections.

As a sample, these afterglow spectra are consistent with this relatively simple model.

In addition, none of the statistically significant features are seen in more than one detector or spectral order where available. We conclude that, to date, no credible X-ray line feature has been detected in a GRB afterglow.

As we move through an environment, we are constantly making assessments, judgments and decisions about the things we encounter. Some are acted upon immediately, but many more become mental notes or fleeting impressions—our implicit 'labeling' of the world. In this paper, we use physiological correlates of this labeling to construct a hybrid brain–computer interface (hBCI) system for efficient navigation of a 3D environment. Approach. First, we record electroencephalographic (EEG), saccadic and pupillary data from subjects as they move through a small part of a 3D virtual city under free-viewing conditions. Using machine learning, we integrate the neural and ocular signals evoked by the objects they encounter to infer which ones are of subjective interest to them. These inferred labels are propagated through a large computer vision graph of objects in the city, using semi-supervised learning to identify other, unseen objects that are visually similar to the labeled ones. Finally, the system plots an efficient route to help the subjects visit the 'similar' objects it identifies. Main results.

We also examined objects previously classified as worm candidates by Koo and collaborators; only seven have a significant portion of their structure falling in the CGPS range of l = 74°–147°, -35 < b < +5.°5. Apart from GW 123.4-1.5, we could not confirm that any of these are coherent structures that extend toward the Milky Way's halo. However, a list of 10 narrow vertical structures found in our search is furnished; one structure is ≳500 pc tall, thus extending from the Galactic plane into the halo. We provide details about these narrow vertical structures, including comparisons between H I, radio continuum, IR, and CO observations.

We searched for SEP events associated with large, bright solar soft X-ray arcades and intense metric noise storms in the western hemisphere, which should be favorable for the production of arcade SEP events observed at 1 AU.

The continuum emission traces a dusty annulus of 45 AU in radius that is consistent with the dust morphology observed at shorter wavelengths. The VLA observations also reveal a compact source at the center of the disk, possibly due to thermal emission from hot dust or ionized gas located within a few AU from the central star. No emission is observed between the star and the dusty ring and, in particular, at the position of the candidate protoplanet LkCa 15 b. By comparing the observations with theoretical models for circumplanetary disk emission, we find that if LkCa 15 b is a massive planet (>5 MJ\n) accreting at a rate greater than 10–6 MJ\n yr–1, then its circumplanetary disk is less massive than 0.1 MJ\n, or smaller than 0.4 Hill radii. Similar constraints are derived for any possible circumplanetary disk orbiting within 45 AU from the central star.

Both lines have low velocity dispersions (σv ~ 60 km s-1) and deconvolved radii r ≈ 1 h kpc. We argue that the lines are Lyα and are powered by stellar ionization.

It is thus important to develop efficient ways to discover new systems both in present and forthcoming data sets. For future large high-resolution imaging surveys we anticipate an ever-growing need for efficiency and for independence from spectroscopic data. In this paper, we exploit the clustering of massive galaxies to perform a high-efficiency imaging search for gravitational lenses. Our data set comprises 44 fields imaged by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS), each of which is centered on a lens discovered by the Strong Lens ACS Survey (SLACS). We compare four different search methods: (1) automated detection with the HST Archive Galaxy-scale Gravitational Lens Survey (HAGGLeS) robot, (2) examining cutout images of bright galaxies (BGs) after subtraction of a smooth galaxy light distribution, (3) examining the unsubtracted BG cutouts, and (4) performing a full-frame visual inspection of the ACS images. We compute purity and completeness and consider investigator time for the four algorithms, using the main SLACS lenses as a testbed. The first and second algorithms perform the best. We present the four new lens systems discovered during this comprehensive search, as well as one other likely candidate. For each new lens we use the fundamental plane to estimate the lens velocity dispersion and predict, from the resulting lens geometry, the redshifts of the lensed sources. Two of these new systems are found in galaxy clusters, which include the SLACS lenses in the two respective fields. Overall we find that the enhanced lens abundance (30+24\n–8 lenses deg–2) is higher than expected for random fields (12+4\n–2 lenses deg–2 for the COSMOS survey).

Ten rotational transitions of this molecule were recorded in the frequency range of 10-40 GHz using FTMW methods, resulting in the assignment of 53 quadrupole-resolved hyperfine lines; in the millimeter-wave region (48-270 GHz), nearly 600 transitions were assigned to the ground (anti-) state.

No transients were detected in observations of high Galactic latitude fields taken from 2013 September though 2014 October.

The VLA rate limit is consistent with past estimates when published flux limits are recalculated with a homogeneous definition that includes effects of primary beam attenuation, dispersion, pulse width, and sky brightness.

We hope that such a special issue could become a particularly valuable reference for the broad scientific community working with the general random search problem.\nThe Editorial Board has invited Marcos G E da Luz, Alexander Y Grosberg, Ernesto P Raposo and Gandhi M Viswanathan to serve as Guest Editors for the special issue.\n\nThe general question of how to optimize the search for specific target objects in either continuous or discrete environments when\nthe information available is limited is of significant importance in a broad range of fields. Representative examples include ecology\n(animal foraging, dispersion of populations), geology (oil recovery from mature reservoirs), information theory (automated researchers of\nregisters in high-capacity database), molecular biology (proteins searching for their sites, e.g., on DNA ), etc.\n\nOne reason underlying the richness of the random search problem relates to the `ignorance' of the locations of the randomly located `targets'.\nA statistical approach to the search problem can deal adequately with incomplete information and so stochastic strategies become advantageous.\nThe general problem of how to search efficiently for randomly located target sites can thus be quantitatively described using the concepts\nand methods of statistical physics and stochastic processes.\nScope\nThus far, to the best of our knowledge, no recent textbook or review article in a physics journal has appeared on this topic. This makes a\nspecial issue with review and research articles attractive to those interested in acquiring a general introduction to the field. The\nsubject can be approached from the perspective of different fields: ecology, networks, transport problems, molecular biology, etc. The\nstudy of the problem is particularly suited to the concepts and methods of statistical physics and stochastic processes; for example, fractals,\nrandom walks, anomalous diffusion. Discrete landscapes can be approached via graph theory, random lattices and complex networks. Such topics are\nregularly discussed in  Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical.

It was found that the global modes with a larger impact on the 8B neutrino flux have a frequency of oscillation in the interval 250 μHz to 500 μHz (or a period in the interval 30 minutes to 70 minutes), such as the f-modes (n = 0) for the low degrees, radial modes of order n ≤ 3, and the dipole mode of order n = 1.

This Bayesian technique can easily be modified to incorporate improved priors on SN properties, and it is well-suited for future high-statistics SN searches in which spectroscopic follow-up of all candidates will be impractical. Here the method is validated on both ground- and space-based SN data having some spectroscopic follow-up. We combine our volumetric rate measurements with low-redshift SN data and fit to a number of possible models for the evolution of the SN Ia rate as a function of redshift. The data do not distinguish between a flat rate at redshift >0.5 and a previously proposed model, in which the Type Ia rate peaks at redshift ~1 due to a significant delay from star formation to the SN explosion.

In order to be more faithful to an actual search, we maximized the SNR over a template bank, whose minimal match is set to 95%. For initial LIGO detector, we claim that the initial eccentricity does not need to be taken into account in our searches for any system with total mass M  [2–45]M⊙ if e0  0.05 because the loss of SNR (about 5%) is consistent with the discreteness of the template bank. Similarly, this statement is also true for systems with M  [6–35]M⊙ and e0  0.10. However, by neglecting the eccentricity in our searches, significant loss of detection (larger than 10%) may arise as soon as e0 ≥ 0.05 for neutron-star binaries. We also provide exhaustive results for VIRGO, Advanced LIGO and Einstein Telescope detectors. It is worth noting that for Einstein Telescope, neutron star binaries with e0 ≥ 0.02 lead to a 10% loss of detection.", "Titre": "Searching for gravitational-wave signals emitted by eccentric compact binaries using a non-eccentric template bank: implications for ground-based detectors", "Type": "Journal article", "LienPDF": "/article/10.1088/0264-9381/26/4/045013/pdf", "doi": "10.1088/0264-9381/26/4/045013"}, {"Id": 799, "Autheur": "K.

If and only if there is significantly neutral gas in the IGM, absorption in the damping wing of the Lyα line will cause the transmission to recover slowly as one moves from absorbed to transmitted portions of the spectrum.

We search for new XMPs in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) in a work that complements Paper I. This time, high electron temperature objects are selected; metals are a main coolant of the gas, so metal-poor objects contain high-temperature gas. Using the algorithm k-means, we classify 788,677 spectra to select 1281 galaxies that have particularly intense [O iii]λ4363 with respect to [O iii]λ5007, which is a proxy for high electron temperature. The metallicity of these candidates was computed using a hybrid technique consistent with the direct method, rendering 196 XMPs. A less restrictive noise constraint provides a larger set with 332 candidates. Both lists are provided in electronic format. The selected XMP sample has a mean stellar mass around , with the dust mass  for typical star-forming regions. In agreement with previous findings, XMPs show a tendency to be tadpole-like or cometary. Their underlying stellar continuum corresponds to a fairly young stellar population (), although young and aged stellar populations coexist at the low-metallicity starbursts. About 10% of the XMPs show large N/O. Based on their location in constrained cosmological numerical simulations, XMPs have a strong tendency to appear in voids and to avoid galaxy clusters.

One is detecting the light-curve anomalies affected by the planetary caustic from continuous monitoring of all events detected by microlensing survey programs (type I strategy), and the other is detecting anomalies near the peak amplification affected by the central caustic from intensive monitoring of high-amplification events (type II strategy). It was shown by Griest & Safizadeh that the type II strategy yields high planet detection efficiency per event. However, it is not known whether the planet detection rate by this strategy can make up a substantial fraction of the total rate. In this paper, we estimate the relative planet detection rates expected under the two follow-up observation strategies. From this estimation, we find that the rate under the type II strategy is substantial and will comprise ~- of the total rate. We also find that compared to the type I strategy the type II strategy is more efficient in detecting planets located outside of the lensing zone.

Particularly, the visualization of voids and air bubbles is advantageous. As a result many studies have appeared in the literature that offer varying degrees of functionality. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) has already been proved to be a hallmark for process monitoring and offers not only the visualization of the resistivity profile for a given flow mixture but is also used for detection of phase boundaries. Iterative image reconstruction algorithms, such as the modified Newton–Raphson (mNR) method, are commonly used as inverse solvers. However, their utility is problematic in a sense that they require the initial solution in close proximity of the ground truth. Furthermore, they also rely on the gradient information of the objective function to be minimized. Therefore, in this paper, we address all these issues by employing a direct search algorithm, namely the Hooke and Jeeves pattern search method, to estimate the phase boundaries that directly minimizes the cost function and does not require the gradient information. It is assumed that the resistivity profile is known a priori and therefore the unknown information will be the size and location of the object. The boundary coefficients are parameterized using truncated Fourier series and are estimated using the relationship between the measured voltages and injected currents.

Natal star-forming regions can be identified by their characteristic thermal radio emission, which is manifest in their spectral index at centimeter wavelengths. The host galaxies in our sample were selected based upon their likelihood of harboring young star formation. In star-forming regions, the ionizing flux of massive embedded stars powers the dominant thermal free-free emission of those sources, resulting in a spectral index of α  –0.2 (where S\nν ∝ να), which we compute. With the current sensitivity, we find that of the 25 galaxies in this sample only 5 have radio sources with spectral indices that are only consistent with a thermal origin, 4 have radio sources that are only consistent with a non-thermal origin, 6 have radio sources whose nature is ambiguous due to uncertainties in the spectral index, and 16 have no detected radio sources. For those sources that appear to be dominated by thermal emission, we infer the ionizing flux of the star clusters and the number of equivalent O7.5 V stars that are required to produce the observed radio flux densities. The most radio-luminous clusters that we detect have an equivalent of ~7 × 103 O7.5 V stars, and the smallest only have an equivalent of ~102 O7.5 V stars; thus these star-forming regions span the range of large OB associations to moderate \"super star clusters.\" With the current detection limits, we also place upper limits on the masses of clusters that could have recently formed; for a number of galaxies we can conclusively rule out the presence of natal clusters significantly more massive than the Galactic star-forming region W49A (~5 × 104\nM\n☉).

Fortunately, these asteroids are known to the Minor Planet Center and can be identified because they move across a resolution element in a matter of hours, orders of magnitude faster than Planet Nine. If Planet Nine is smaller, colder, and/or more distant than expected, then it could be as faint as 1 mJy at 1 mm. There are roughly 106 asteroids this bright and many are unknown, making current cosmology experiments confusion limited for moving sources. Nonetheless, it may still be possible to find the proverbial needle in the haystack using a matched filter. This would require millimeter telescopes with high angular resolution and high sensitivity in order to alleviate confusion and to enable the identification of moving sources with relatively short time baselines. Regardless of its millimeter flux density, searching for Planet Nine would require frequent radio measurements for large swaths of the sky, including the ecliptic and Galactic plane.

We restrict our stellar sample to include the 12,000 stars having the lowest photometric noise in the Kepler survey, thereby maximizing the detectability of Earth-size planets.

(1) The mixing ratios of parent volatiles measured at 1.49 AU and 1.21 AU agree within confidence limits, consistent with homogeneous composition in the mean volatile release from the nucleus of C/2004 Q2. Notably, the relative abundance of C2H6/C2H2 is substantially higher than those measured in other comets, while the mixing ratios C2H6/H2O, CH3OH/H2O, and HCN/H2O are similar to those observed in comets, referred to as \"organics-normal\".

Bars in massive and bulge-dominated galaxies (B/T > 0.2) show a flat profile, while bars in less massive, disk-dominated galaxies (B/T ~ 0) show an exponential, disk-like profile with a wider spread in the radial profile than in the bulge-dominated galaxies. The global two-dimensional shapes of bars, however, are rectangular/boxy, independent of the bulge or disk properties. We speculate that because bars are formed out of disks, bars initially have an exponential (disk-like) profile that evolves over time, trapping more disk stars to boxy bar orbits. This leads bars to become stronger and have flatter profiles. The narrow spread of bar radial profiles in more massive disks suggests that these bars formed earlier (z > 1), while the disk-like profiles and a larger spread in the radial profile in less massive systems imply a later and more gradual evolution, consistent with the cosmological evolution of bars inferred from observational studies. Therefore, we expect that the flatness of the bar profile can be used as a dynamical age indicator of the bar to measure the time elapsed since the bar formation.

Over the last decade, several lines of evidence have been presented showing that core accretion is most likely the dominant mechanism for the close-in population of planets probed by radial velocity and transits. However, this does not by itself prove that core accretion is the dominant mode for the total planet population, since disk instability might conceivably produce and retain large numbers of planets in the far-out regions of the disk. If this is a relevant scenario, then the outer massive disks of B-stars should be among the best places for massive planets and brown dwarfs to form and reside.

By comparing our sensitivities to model predictions of disk instability based on physical criteria for fragmentation and cooling, and using Monte Carlo simulations for orbital distributions, we find that ~85% of such companions should have been detected in our images on average. Given this high degree of completeness, stringent statistical limits can be set from the null-detection result, even with the limited sample size.

As proper flux thresholds are exceeded, alerts are automatically generated and sent as SMS messages to cellular telephones, via e-mail, and via push notifications from an application for smartphones and tablets. These alerts are crosschecked with the results of two pipelines, and a manual analysis is performed. Being a small scientific-class mission, AGILE is characterized by optimization of both scientific analysis and ground-segment resources.

These 1-3 Myr old T Tauri stars present significant challenges to traditional RV surveys. The presence of strong magnetic fields gives rise to large, cool star spots. These spots introduce significant RV jitter which can mimic the velocity modulation from a planet-mass companion. To distinguish between spot-induced and planet-induced RV modulation, we conduct observations at ~6700 Å and ~2.3 μm and measure the wavelength dependence (if any) in the RV amplitude. CSHELL observations of the known exoplanet host Gl 86 demonstrate our ability to detect not only hot Jupiters in the near-infrared but also secular trends from more distant companions. Observations of nine very young stars reveal a typical reduction in RV amplitude at the longer wavelengths by a factor of ~2-3.

The search targets low Galactic latitudes, |b|  5°, in the accessible longitude ranges 32°  ℓ  77° and 168°  ℓ  214°. The instrumentation, data processing, initial survey observations, sensitivity, and database management are described. Data discussed here were collected over a 100 MHz passband centered on 1.42 GHz using a spectrometer that recorded 256 channels every 64 μs. Analysis of the data with their full time and frequency resolutions is ongoing. Here we report the results of a preliminary, low-resolution analysis for which the data were decimated to speed up the processing. We have detected 29 previously known pulsars and discovered 11 new ones. One of these, PSR J1928+1746, with a period of 69 ms and a relatively low characteristic age of 82 kyr, is a plausible candidate for association with the unidentified EGRET source 3EG J1928+1733. Another, PSR J1906+07, is a nonrecycled pulsar in a relativistic binary with an orbital period of 3.98 hr. In parallel with the periodicity analysis, we also search the data for isolated dispersed pulses. This technique has resulted in the discovery of PSR J0628+09, an extremely sporadic radio emitter with a spin period of 1.2 s. Simulations we have carried out indicate that ~1000 new pulsars will be found in our ALFA survey. In addition to providing a large sample for use in population analyses and for probing the magnetoionic interstellar medium, the survey maximizes the chances of finding rapidly spinning millisecond pulsars and pulsars in compact binary systems.

PSR J1833-1034, with spin period P = 61.8 ms and dispersion measure 169 cm-3 pc, is very faint, with pulse-averaged flux density of ≈70 μJy at a frequency of 1.4 GHz, and was first detected in a deep search with the Parkes telescope. Subsequent observations with Parkes and the Green Bank Telescope have confirmed this detection and yield a period derivative  = 2.02 × 10-13. These spin parameters imply a characteristic age τc = 4.8 kyr and a spin-down luminosity Ė = 3.3 × 1037 ergs s-1, the latter value exceeded only by the Crab pulsar among the rotation-powered pulsars known in our Galaxy. The pulsar has an unusually steep radio spectrum in the 0.8-2.0 GHz range, with power-law index ≈3.0, and a narrow single-peaked pulse profile with FWHM of 0.04P. We have analyzed 350 ks of archival Chandra X-Ray Observatory HRC data and find a pointlike source of luminosity ≈3 × 10-5Ė, offset from the center of an elliptical region of size ≈7'' × 5'' and luminosity ≈10-3Ė within which likely lies the pulsar wind termination shock. We have searched for X-ray pulsations in a 30 ks HRC observation without success, deriving a pulsed fraction upper limit for a sinusoidal pulse shape of about 70% of the pulsar flux. We revisit the distance to G21.5-0.9 based on H I and CO observations, arguing that it is 4.7 ± 0.4 kpc. We use existing X-ray and radio observations of the pulsar wind nebula, along with the measured properties of its engine and a recent detection of the supernova remnant shell, to argue that G21.5-0.9 and PSR J1833-1034 are much younger than τc and likely their true age is 1000 yr.

Detection of a small number of M subdwarf binaries reported in the literature suggests a higher fraction than the one obtained here, probably comparable to that found for the more massive solar-type stars in the halo (13%-15%). Comparison with the disk M dwarf fraction (~25%), however, suggests multiplicity to be rare among the lowest mass halo stars, implying the two populations formed under different initial conditions. The low binary fraction in our survey could be explained by selection biases. A decrease in multiplicity has been observed in the disk for masses below 0.1 M☉, the peak in the disk mass function (MF). The globular cluster MF is found to peak at about 0.33 M☉, with a decrease in the number of stars per unit mass below the peak mass. Our sample being composed of stars with masses between ~0.2 and 0.085 M☉ suggests that a decrease in multiplicity similar to the disk may also be true for the halo stars, but perhaps below a mass of ~0.3 M☉.

In order to clarify the key conditions for reproducing such high velocity of 56Ni, we revisit matter mixing in aspherical core-collapse supernova explosions. Explosions are initiated artificially by injecting thermal and kinetic energies around the interface between the iron core and the silicon-rich layer. Perturbations of 5% or 30% amplitude in the radial velocities are introduced at several points in time. We find that no high velocity 56Ni can be obtained if we consider bipolar explosions with perturbations (5% amplitude) of pre-supernova origins. If large perturbations (30% amplitude) are introduced or exist due to some unknown mechanism in a later phase just before the shock wave reaches the hydrogen envelope, 56Ni with a velocity of 3000 km s–1 can be obtained. Aspherical explosions that are asymmetric across the equatorial plane with clumpy structures in the initial shock waves are investigated. We find that the clump sizes affect the penetration of 56Ni.

Past studies of SN Ibc host environments have been biased toward high-mass, high-metallicity galaxies by focusing on SNe discovered in galaxy-targeted SN searches. Our new observations more than double the total number of spectroscopic stellar population age and metallicity measurements published for untargeted SN Ibc host environments. For the 12 SNe Ib and 21 SNe Ic in our metallicity sample, we find median metallicities of 0.62 Z\n☉ and 0.83 Z\n☉, respectively, but determine that the discrepancy in the full distribution of metallicities is not statistically significant. This median difference would correspond to only a small difference in the mass loss via metal-line-driven winds ( 30%), suggesting this does not play the dominant role in distinguishing SNe Ib and Ic progenitors. However, the median metallicity of the seven broad-lined SNe Ic (SNe Ic-BL) in our sample is significantly lower, 0.45 Z\n☉. The age of the young stellar population of SN Ic-BL host environments also seems to be lower than for SNe Ib and Ic, but our age sample is small. Combining all SN Ibc host environment spectroscopy from the literature to date does not reveal a significant difference in SN Ib and Ic metallicities, but reinforces the significance of the lower metallicities for SNe Ic-BL. This combined sample demonstrates that galaxy-targeted SN searches introduce a significant bias for studies seeking to infer the metallicity distribution of SN progenitors, and we identify and discuss other systematic effects that play smaller roles.

However, we know very little about the secular processes associated with disk evolution. One major uncertainty is the extent to which stars migrate radially through the disk, thereby washing out signatures of their past (e.g., birth sites). Recent theoretical work finds that such \"blurring\" of the disk can be important if spiral arms are transient phenomena. Here we describe an experiment to determine the importance of diffusion from the Solar circle with cosmic time. Consider a star cluster that has been placed into a differentially rotating, stellar fluid. We show that all clusters up to ~104 M\n☉ in mass, and a significant fraction of those up to ~105 M\n☉, are expected to be chemically homogeneous, and that clusters of this size can be assigned a unique \"chemical tag\" by measuring the abundances of 10 independent element groups, with better age and orbit determinations allowing fewer abundance measurements. The star cluster therefore acts like a \"tracer dye,\" and the present-day distribution of its stars provides a strong constraint on the rate of radial diffusion or migration in the Galactic disk. A star cluster of particular interest for this application is the \"Solar family\"—the stars that were born with the Sun. If we were able to identify a significant fraction of these, we could determine whether the Sun was born at its present radius or much further in. We show all-sky projections for the Solar family under different dynamical scenarios and identify the most advantageous fields on the sky for the experiment. Sellwood & Binney have argued for strong radial transport driven by transient spiral perturbations: in principle, we could measure the strength of this migration directly. In searching for the Solar family, we would also identify many thousands of other chemically homogeneous groups, providing a wealth of additional information.

We report the identification of a new DN in M13, the 14th DN identified in a GC to date. Using the 2 m Faulkes Telescope North, we conducted a search for stars in M13 that show variability over a year (2005-2006) on timescales of days and months. This led to the detection of one DN showing several outbursts. A Chandra X-ray source is coincident with this DN and shows both a spectrum and variability consistent with that expected from a DN, thus supporting the identification. We searched for a counterpart in Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys/Wide Field Camera archived images and found at least 11 candidates, of which we could characterize only the 7 brightest, including one with a 3σ Hα excess and a faint blue star. The detection of one DN when more could have been expected likely indicates that our knowledge of the global Galactic population of cataclysmic variables is too limited.

Accretion of the interstellar medium onto an isolated black hole is expected to result in a blended, thermal synchrotron spectrum, roughly flat from the optical to the far-infrared. We find that the Sloan Survey will be sensitive to isolated black holes in the range 1-100 M☉ out to a few hundred parsecs. We find that multiband photometry can distinguish black holes from field stars, with black holes having colors similar to QSOs. The holes may then be isolated from QSOs because they have a featureless spectrum with no emission lines. The Sloan Survey will likely find hundreds of objects that meet these criteria, and to reduce the number of candidates we suggest other selection criteria such as infrared observations and proper-motion measurements. If no black hole candidates are found in this survey, important limits can be placed on the local density of black holes and the halo fraction in black holes.", "Titre": "Searching for Stellar Mass Black Holes in the Solar Neighborhood", "Type": "Journal article", "LienPDF": "/article/10.1086/310362/pdf", "doi": "10.1086/310362"}, {"Id": 898, "Autheur": "Hee-Suk Cho", "Annee": "2015", "Resume": "The phenomenological gravitational waveform models, which we refer to as PhenomA, PhenomB, and PhenomC, generate full inspiral, merger, and ringdown (IMR) waveforms of coalescing binary back holes (BBHs).

PhenomA has been developed for nonspinning BBH waveforms, while PhenomB and PhenomC were designed to model the waveforms of BBH systems with nonprecessing (aligned) spins, but can also be used for nonspinning systems. In this work, we study the validity of the phenomenological models for nonspinning BBH searches at low masses,  and  with Advanced LIGO.

In this paper, we present a detailed study of the LAT observations relevant to Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) event GW150914, which is the first direct detection of gravitational waves and has been interpreted as being due to the coalescence of two stellar-mass black holes. The localization region for GW150914 was outside the LAT FoV at the time of the GW signal. However, as part of routine survey observations, the LAT observed the entire LIGO localization region within ~70 minutes of the trigger and thus enabled a comprehensive search for a γ-ray counterpart to GW150914. The study of the LAT data presented here did not find any potential counterparts to GW150914, but it did provide limits on the presence of a transient counterpart above 100 MeV on timescales of hours

scale, known as the hierarchy problem, is addressed in certain models through the postulate of extra spatial dimensions. A search for evidence of extra spatial dimensions in the diphoton channel has been performed using the full set of proton–proton collisions at  recorded in 2011 with the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. This dataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 4.9 fb−1. The diphoton invariant mass spectrum is observed to be in good agreement with the Standard Model expectation. In the context of the model proposed by Arkani–Hamed, Dimopoulos and Dvali, 95% confidence level lower limits of between 2.52 and 3.92 TeV are set on the ultraviolet cutoff scale MS depending on the number of extra dimensions and the theoretical formalism used. In the context of the Randall–Sundrum model, a lower limit of 2.06 (1.00) TeV at 95% confidence level is set on the mass of the lightest graviton for couplings of . Combining with the ATLAS dilepton searches based on the 2011 data, the 95% confidence level lower limit on the Randall–Sundrum graviton mass is further tightened to 2.23 (1.03) TeV for .", "Titre":

While plausible candidates are known for both the single-degenerate and double-degenerate models, the observed numbers fall significantly short of what is required to reproduce the SNe Ia rate. Some of the most promising single-degenerate Type Ia progenitors are recurrent novae and super-soft sources (SSS). White dwarfs (WDs) with higher mass transfer rates can also be SN Ia progenitors. For these rapidly accreting white dwarfs (RAWDs), more material than is needed for steady burning accretes on the WD, and extends the WD's photosphere. Unlike SSS, such objects will likely not be detectable at soft X-ray energies, but will be bright at longer wavelengths, such as the far-ultraviolet (UV). Possible examples include LMC N66 and the V Sagittae stars. We present a survey using multi-object spectrographs looking for RAWDs in the central core of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), from objects selected to be bright in the far-UV and with blue far UV – V colors. While we find some unusual objects, and recover known planetary nebula and Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars, we detect no candidate RAWD. The upper limits from this non-detection depend on our expectations of what an RAWD should look like, as well assumptions about the internal extinction of the SMC. Assuming they resemble LMC N66 or fainter versions of WR stars we set an upper limit of 10-14 RAWDs in the SMC.

The absence of suboptimal local maxima for the relevant control landscapes is numerically illustrated. The dependence of the optimization search effort is analyzed in terms of the dimension of the system N, the initial state ρi and the target observable Θ. It is found that if the number of nonzero eigenvalues in ρi remains constant, the search effort does not exhibit any significant dependence on N.

The position of the spot is very favorable for the detection of overturning downflows at the edges of penumbral filaments. Our analysis is based on measurements of the Fe I 709.0 nm line taken with the Littrow spectrograph of the Swedish 1 m Solar Telescope under excellent seeing conditions.

The velocities are calibrated using a nearby telluric line, with systematic errors smaller than 150 m s–1. Deep in the photosphere, as sampled by the bisectors at the 80%-88% intensity levels, we always observe blueshifts or zero velocities. The maximum blueshifts reach 1.2 km s–1 and tend to be cospatial with bright penumbral filaments. In the line core, we detect blueshifts for the most part, with small velocities not exceeding 300 m s–1. Redshifts also occur, but at the level of 100-150 m s–1, and only occasionally.

The strategy of this search changed considerably from that reported in 1996. To maximize the image contrast between potential FCs and a target star's point-spread function, we adopted the F1042M filter (λc ~ 1.02 μm, Δλ ~ 0.04 μm) as the primary bandpass of our search. Although our sensitivity to FCs varied with the brightness of and separation from our target stars, an ultimate 10 σ detection limit of m1042 ≈ 18 within 17'' of the fainter targets was achieved. As the end of the main sequence occurs at M1042 ≈ 12, this detection limit makes our search for FCs to nearby stars the most sensitive yet published. Despite this great sensitivity, no previously undetected FCs were found. Our survey would have detected all stellar companions within 17'' of our target stars, except for any lowest mass companions lying within 05–1'' of the brightest (V < 1.5) targets. Applying recent models of brown dwarf spectra and evolution, we find that our search was sensitive to young (0.5 Gyr), low-mass (less than 10 MJ) brown dwarf companions to the fainter targets within 5 pc. A brown dwarf with mass 40 MJ and age 5 Gyr would have been detected at separations greater than 5'' from Gl 559A (α Centauri A).

In addition, we have searched for and set meaningful abundance limits on several carbon chain and ring molecules such as C7H, H2C5, c-H2C5, and biogenic molecules such as pyrrole and glycine.

Maps of CCS and HC7N display abundance ratio variations of 3-5 along individual lines of sight. The high degree of clumpiness, transient nature of clumps, and gas-phase enrichment adequately explain the \"early-time\" chemistry and the molecular complexity in TMC-1. This enrichment has interesting implications for hydrocarbon chemistry in TMC-1, and presumably other clumpy, dark clouds. Specifically, the large number of clumps at various stages of early-time chemical evolution increases the chances for detection of complex hydrocarbons, since the probability of observing a clump at the time of peak abundance for a given molecular species is increased. We suggest two mechanisms for explaining the small-scale variations: (1) the passage of MHD waves in a clumpy medium and (2) grain impacts during clump-clump collisions. In the quiescent region far from any protostar, the MHD activity can be generated locally by clump collisions. The passage of MHD waves helps maintain early-time chemistry in the clumps. Both mechanisms provide enough energy to raise grain temperatures from 10 K to Tcrit ~ 30 K, sufficient to cause reactive radical explosions in grain mantles and thermal desorption. In this manner, the mantle injection causes TMC-1 to exhibit some aspects of \"hot-core\" chemistry, as seen in more massive star-forming regions.

The observations were performed using Spitzer IRAC 4.5 and 8 μm bandpasses and were designed to cover at least one rotational period of each object; 1 σ rms uncertainties of less than 3 mmag at 4.5 μm and around 9 mmag at 8 μm were achieved.

Although the lack of detectable 8 μm variation suggests an instrumental origin for the detected variations, the data may nevertheless still be consistent with intrinsic variability, since the shorter wavelength IRAC bandpasses probe more deeply into late L dwarf atmospheres than the longer wavelengths. A cloud feature occupying a small percentage (1%-2%) of the visible hemisphere could account for the observed amplitude of variation. If, instead, the variability is indeed instrumental in origin, then our nonvariable L dwarfs could be either completely covered with clouds or objects whose clouds are smaller and uniformly distributed.

Motivated by these findings we studied the spectral properties of a sample of bright ULXs using a simple continuum model which was extensively used to fit the X-ray spectra of accreting magnetic NSs in the Galaxy. We found that such a model, consisting of a power-law with a high-energy exponential cut-off, fits most of the ULX spectra analyzed here very well, at a level comparable to that of models involving an accreting BH.

Three have been identified previously: the Sirius and Hercules moving groups and a stream found independently in 2006 by Arifyanto & Fuchs and Helmi et al. In addition, we find a new stream candidate on a quite radial orbit, suggesting an origin external to the Milky Way's disk. Also, there is evidence for the Arcturus stream and the Hyades-Pleiades moving group in the sample. The detections are further supported by analyzing the stellar distribution in velocity and angular momentum space using the Monte Carlo simulations. We find that the significance of overdensities is comparable, independent of the space in which the stream search is conducted. This analysis, using only a minute fraction of the final RAVE data set, shows the power of this experiment to probe the phase-space substructure of stars around the Sun.", "Titre": "Identifying Stellar Streams in the First RAVE Public Data Release", "Type": "Journal article", "LienPDF": "/article/10.1086/590139/pdf", "doi": "10.1086/590139"}, {"Id": 983, "Autheur": "Keith A.

We discuss the impact of selection effects on the detectability and classification of intermittent sources, and compare the efficiencies of periodicity and single-pulse (SP) searches for various pulsar classes.

In other cases, the intermittency appears to be intrinsic to the source. No transients were found with DMs large enough to require that they originate from sources outside our Galaxy.
